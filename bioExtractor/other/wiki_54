The Brothers Karamazov

The Brothers Karamazov () is a Russian novel written by Fyodor Dostoevsky. Dostoevsky said, "I'd die happy if I could finish this final [last] novel, for I would have expressed myself completely."
"The Brothers Karamazov" is the story of the lives of three Russian brothers who are very different in body, mind, and spirit, and are often thought of as representing those three parts of mankind. It was written in 1879 to 1880 in Russia, mostly in St. Petersburg. It was published in 1879 to 1880 in a series. It is his most complicated and deep novel, and most people think it is Dostoevsky’s greatest.
There are four brothers in the Karamazov family: Ivan, the atheist ; Dmitry, the emotional lover of women; Alyosha, the "hero" and Christian; and twisted, Smerdyakov, the child, who is treated as the family servant. Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov is a very careless father and woman-lover. Dmitry comes to hate him because his father loves the same woman as he does, Grushenka, and because of this, he often threatens that he will kill his father. When Fyodor Pavlovich is killed by Smerdyakov, he is accused of killing his father.
Throughout the book there is a search for truth: about man, about life, and about God. After it was published, all kinds of people such as Sigmund Freud, Albert Einstein, and Pope Benedict XVI thought it was the greatest book in all .
Fyodor Dostoevsky was born in 1821, the son of an army doctor. While he was away at the Academy of Engineers, his father died - reportedly murdered by his own servants. Though disagree whether Dostoevsky's father was really murdered or not, Dostoevsky apparently believed that his father had been murdered, and it is even possible that he felt feelings of guilt for it, as if he had been the one who had killed his father. People like Sigmund Freud argue that this had an influence when he wrote "The Brothers Karamazov". After 17 years of schooling and family life in Moscow, he spent six years in St Petersburg as an officer. He resigned in 1844, and two years later became famous with his first published book, "Poor Folk". Young Dostoevsky began to become involved with the Petrashevsky Circle - a group of political discussion groups by young people in St Petersburg who did not like the rule of Emperor Nicholas I. Because of this, Dostoevsky was arrested and held for eight months in the prisons of the Fortress of St Peter and St Paul. Meanwhile, he was put on trial while he was away and sentenced to death.
On 22 December 1849 8 A.M. he was pretended to be led out, with twenty other people, for execution by firing squad in the Semenovsky Square in St Petersburg. The first group was actually and tied up, while the second group watched. This terrible mock execution made one of the prisoners go insane. But then the order was suddenly changed, and he was given "katorga" (labor in Siberia) for four years. This had a great influence on his life. After that, he was to serve the military in Siberian .
Dostoevsky’s four years in prison camp greatly influenced his book and his life. He began to suffer from epilepsy when he was in prison, and would have epilepsy for the rest of his life. He shows how epilepsy feels like through the character Smerdyakov. Also, in prison he began believing in God, and having religious and philosophical inclinations. Through the character Rakitin, Dostoevsky makes fun of the “clever people” who jumped from one popular idea to another without caring about the truth. In prison, he also met Ilyinsky, who had been sent to prison for killing his father. Almost ten years after he met Ilyinsky, Dostoevsky found out that Ilyinsky was innocent and later became free when the real murderer confessed. Dmitry Karamazov is like Ilyinsky in many ways.
Also, shortly before he wrote "The Brothers Karamazov", his own son, Alexei, died. He creates in Alyosha what his son possibly might have been like, and reflects his own sadness in scenes where Captain Snegriev loses Ilyusha, or when Zosima comforts a woman who has lost her little son, Alexei.
Throughout, Dostoevsky was concerned with the justice of God and the idea that "if God does not exist, then everything is permitted (allowed)."
When he was young, Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov was a and man who liked money and women too much. From his first wife, Adelaida, he had one son, Dmitry Karamazov. From his second wife, Sophia, he had Ivan and Alyosha Karamazov. Karamazov does not care about his sons, and they are all brought up by friends and relatives. Dmitry, who is a soldier, comes back when he is twenty-eight years old to take an his mother had left to him. Karamazov wants the inheritance for himself, and they get angry and fight with each other. Cold, clever Ivan is called to stop their fight, and the , kind Alyosha, who also lives at the town, comes to help. Alyosha studies in a monastery with the Elder Zosima. Dmitry and Fyodor agree that maybe Elder Zosima can help stop their fight, and Alyosha, though feeling worried about the meeting, says he will arrange it.
Fyodor Karamazov is vulgar, sarcastic and mocking at the meeting, and tries to make everybody angry and uncomfortable with his talk and stories. Alyosha is very sad and embarrassed. The Elder Zosima, however, is calm, polite, and even kind to him even when Karamazov is mocking (making fun of) him, telling him to be honest with himself.
Dmitry arrives late, and the meeting soon becomes a big fight between father and son. They are not only angry at each other because of money: they are both in love with Grushenka, a beautiful woman living in the town. While they are fighting, the Elder Zosima suddenly bows down to Dmitry, saying, “Forgive me!” Dmitry is very shocked, and later Zosima explains to Alyosha that he knows Dmitry is going to have very much suffering. In the middle of their fight, the elder also goes out to give advice to lots of people, including Mrs. Khokhlakov, whose daughter, Lise, keeps on laughing at the awkward Alyosha. He also comforts a woman whose three-year-old-son has died. This is probably an echo of Dostoevsky’s sadness about his dead son.
Four years ago, Fyodor Karamazov became a father to a fourth son, Smerdyakov. Smerdyakov’s mother was a retarded and mute (unable to speak) woman called “Stinking Lizaveta.” Lizaveta died when she gave birth to Smerdyakov, and he became Karamazov’s servant. Smerdyakov grows up to have a strange and mean personality, and has epilepsy. Even though Karamazov always treats him like a servant, though, he is not stupid. He likes to talk about philosophy with Ivan and soon agrees with lots of Ivan’s ideas, especially the idea that the soul does not live forever and so there is no good or evil.
Dmitry explains to Alyosha that when he was a soldier, he was angry that beautiful Katerina kept on ignoring him and he tried to her by saying he would give her 4,500 rubles her father needed to pay his debt if she came to his house. When her father tries to kill himself because of the debt, she comes to Dmitry’s house at night like he told her to. However, he is so amazed and by her self-sacrifice that he just gives her the money without trying to seduce her. Shocked, Katerina kneels and bows down to him, “like a simple Russian woman,” and runs out. Later, when a relative gave her a lot of money, she offered to marry Dmitry, and they became engaged. But when they came to Karamazov’s town, he fell in love with Grushenka instead, and even stole 3,000 rubles from Katerina to have a wild party with Grushenka. He asks Alyosha to tell Katerina that he cannot be engaged to her anymore, and also asks Alyosha to get 3,000 rubles from his father so he can pay Katerina back. Alyosha sadly agrees. He goes to his father’s house, where he argues about God with Ivan. In the middle of their argument, Dmitry suddenly runs in and “…all hell seemed to have broken loose…” He beats up his father and threatens to kill him someday. Alyosha helps his hurt father, and goes to visit Katerina at Mrs. Khokalov’s house.
When he goes there, he is shocked to see Grushenka there, too. Grushenka had just promised Katerina she would not marry Dmitry, and she would marry a lover she used to have long ago instead. Katerina is so happy she cries out that Grushenka is a “…dear angel,” and that she “has brought me back to life and made me happy.” Katerina even kisses Grushenka’s hands and lips, and “…acted as though she were in love with Grushenka.” But Grushenka suddenly insults Katerina, saying she might stay with Dmitry after all. “…just now I thought to myself: ‘And what if I take a fancy to him again, that Mitya fellow, since I took a fancy to him once and it lasted nearly a whole hour? I may even go right now and tell him to come and stay with me’…That’s how fickle (changing) I am.” She also talks about Katerina’s visit to Dmitry at night, crying, “…going to visit gentlemen after dark to try and peddle (sell) your charms for money? Why, I know all about that.” This makes Katerina so angry she goes into a hysterical fit. As Alyosha goes out of the house, a maid gives him a letter from Lise. Lise writes that she loves him and wants to marry him. Alyosha laughs “quietly and sweetly” as he reads the letter, and praying for all the sad people he loves, he goes to a peaceful sleep.
Zosima, knowing he will die soon, talks to the monks and to Alyosha about faith, love, and goodness. He also says that humans should not be judgmental, and “…above all, remember—do not be proud!” He also says, “Do not hate…Never cease to explain the Gospels to the people…Do not be avaricious (greedy)…Do not hoard…Have faith and defend its banner. Raise it, raise it high.”
Alyosha goes to visit Mrs. Khokhlakov’s house to see Katerina. On the way, he sees a group of boys throwing rocks at another small boy, who proudly and fights back. When the boy runs away, Alyosha tries to talk to him, but the boy hits him with a rock and bites his finger. Alyosha is concerned and sad.
He is surprised to see Ivan with Katerina, and realizes they love each other very much. He tries to make them be honest with themselves and realize their own feelings, but they are too proud to do so. Ivan thinks his love is not important and that Katerina needs Dmitry in her life, not him. Katerina, who has been very hurt because of Dmitry, thinks that she can never be happy and everybody will betray her in the end, so she proudly tries to sacrifice herself for other people. Ivan leaves.
Katerina tells Alyosha that Dmitry beat and a man named Captain Snegriev in front of his young son, and she asked him to “very tactfully, very delicately, as you and you only can do…try to give him these two hundred roubles.” Alyosha agrees. He goes to Captain Snegriev’s house and finds out that he is suffering even more than they knew: he was extremely poor, his children were sick, and his wife was mad; and Dmitry’s angry humiliation of him had taken away his honor, too. He also realizes that Ilyusha, his son, was the boy who bit his finger angrily, and now he knows that Ilyusha did like that because he was Dmitry’s brother: and because a rock hit Ilyusha in the chest, he has gotten very sick. Alyosha tries to give the 200 roubles to Captain Snegriev. At first he is overjoyed, but he is too proud to take it, and throwing the money down, runs away crying.
Alyosha has lunch with his brother Ivan in a restaurant, and Ivan explains to him why he cannot believe in God: “Listen: if everyone must suffer, in order to buy eternal harmony with their suffering, pray tell me what have children to do with it? It’s quite why they should have to suffer, and why they should buy harmony with their suffering.” He says that to love God would be like a tortured man loving his torturer. Alyosha reminds Ivan about Christ, and Ivan, in a famous chapter of the book, says a prose poem he made up called The Grand .
The Grand Inquisitor is a story about how in the 16th century, Jesus comes to a town in Spain. He begins to heal sick people, but a very powerful cardinal puts him in jail. At night, the cardinal says to Jesus that free will for humans is bad and impossible. “You overestimated them…Man is weak and .” He talks about Jesus’ rejecting (saying no) to Satan’s three were wrong. He says that people with free will are usually too weak to have strong faith, and most people will be damned forever. Because of this, he says, the Church is trying to give people security instead of freedom. He finishes his speech by saying angrily, “…if anyone has ever deserved our fire, it is You, and I shall have you burned tomorrow. Dixi!”
He waits for his prisoner to say something. But suddenly, quietly, Jesus goes to the old man and “kisses him gently on his old, bloodless lips. And that is His only answer.”
The Grand Inquisitor, shocked, lets Jesus out and says he must never come back. Jesus leaves. When Alyosha asks, “What about the old man?” Ivan replies, “The kiss in his heart…But the old man sticks to his old idea.”
As Ivan finishes his story, he says, “…everything is permitted, but then, will you, too, turn your back on me?” But Alyosha goes to him and kisses him softly on his lips. Ivan is touched, and says Alyosha took that from his poem. Ivan leaves, and Alyosha goes back to Zosima, who is dying.
Alyosha hears Zosima’s last lesson of love and forgiveness for everyone, saying that humans should not judge each other but have trust in God. He says that Alyosha reminds him of his older brother, who died when he was young. When Elder Zosima was young, he had been a wild and impious man in the army. He had challenged another man to a duel because of a girl. Before the duel, however, his heart was changed, and after the other man shot at him, he did not shoot his gun at the other person. He left the army and joined the shortly after. He talks about how much he loves the Bible and how people should all love each other. When he has finished his speech, he suddenly goes down to the floor, opens his arms as if he is embracing (hugging) the world, “praying and kissing the ground—as he had taught others to do—quietly and joyfully he gave up his soul to God.” Zosima’s last lesson is very different from Ivan’s arguments, and the story about the guilty man who repented (was sorry), becomes free, and is forgiven is almost an opposite with the story of the Grand Inquisitor, where an innocent man is put in jail and judged. Zosima dies happy, and his final act is a symbol of everything he taught in his life.
Most people all think that because Zosima was so holy, his body will not decay, and some miracle will happen. It shocks everybody when Zosima’s body begins to have a bad smell and decay very quickly after his death. His enemies rudely say this means Zosima was not a saint but an evil person in disguise: for instance, crazily tries to make demons go out of Zosima’s room. Alyosha is very, very shocked and feels even angry that God could let such a wise,holy and good man like Zosima be so humiliated. He feels doubtful and sad, and without thinking, says yes when Rakitin makes him visit Grushenka. Rakitin and Grushenka both wanted Alyosha to be “sinful” like them. But instead of his becoming defiled (dirty), Alyosha and Grushenka become comforted by each other. They become friends: Grushenka makes Alyosha have faith and hope again after Zosima’s death, and Alyosha helps the confused Grushenka spiritually. That night, he sees Zosima in a dream, and Zosima tells him he has done a good deed for Grushenka. He wakes up standing, and going outside, falls down and kisses the earth, like how Zosima died: “He did not know why he was hugging the earth, why he could not kiss it enough, why he longed (wanted) to kiss it all…He kissed it again and again, drenching (making wet) with his tears, vowing (promising) to love it always, always…He was a weak youth when he fell on the ground, and he rose a strong and determined fighter. He knew it…And never, never thereafter (after that) would Alyosha forget that moment.”
Dmitry tries all kinds of things wildly to try to pay Katerina the money he has stolen from her. No one will borrow him the money, and he has nothing to sell. Finally he goes to Grushenka’s house, and when he finds she is not there, he rushes to his father’s house. There, he is caught by Gregory, an old servant, and panicking, he hits Gregory and leaves him bloody and . He goes back to Grushenka’s house, and is shocked when he hears that Grushenka went back to her old lover. He decides he must kill himself, but wants to see Grushenka one last time before he does. However, when he goes to see Grushenka, her “real lover” is actually a silly, old and ugly Pole who cheats at cards. When Grushenka sees him cheat and hears the coarse and mean things he says, she realizes she actually loves Dmitry, not the Pole. When he insults her, Dmitry locks him up in the room. They begin a wild party with fruit and wine he has bought with thousands of rubles he mysteriously and suddenly has gotten, and he and Grushenka plan their future together. Dmitry is still worried about paying Katerina back, and he is afraid Gregory might die. Suddenly, some officers rush in and arrest him. Fyodor Karamazov has been murdered, and they think Dmitry did it.
The police question Dmitry, and are very suspicious of him because he has suddenly gotten so much money, and because everybody said he had blood on his hands as soon as he came out of his father's house. They say he must stand on trial. Dmitry says that the money he had was gotten this way: when he had stolen money from Katerina, he had spent only half of it and sewed the rest secretly into a little bag, and when he had heard Grushenka had run off with the Pole, he had decided to just spend the rest of it in a wild party before he killed himself; however, nobody believes him, and he is put in jail.
Meanwhile, Alyosha has made friends with the schoolboys who had been throwing rocks at Ilyusha, and makes them be friends again. Alyosha helps Ilyusha’s family, and all the boys love him very much. He becomes friends with Kolya, a boy about two years older than Ilyusha, who is proud and “immensely enjoyed” bossing the younger boys around. Kolya is very impressed with Alyosha, and says, “…there’s only one person in the world who can tell Kolya Krasotkin what to do,” meaning Alyosha; he even cries, “Oh, Karamazov, we’ll become very close friends. And shall I tell you what I like most about you? It’s that you treat me just like an equal. But we are not equals—you are by far my superior (better than me)!” Kolya is very clever and knows it, but when he talks to Alyosha about what he thinks of life, Alyosha quickly sees that his “philosophy” is just lots of ideas mixed up together from Rakitin; however, Alyosha respectfully listens to him and tells him clearly what "he" thinks about life. A doctor that Katerina sent comes and says that Ilyusha will die, and Kolya finally begins to cry out loud at the sight of his sick, unhappy friend.
Alyosha visits Grushenka, who has changed spiritually. Even though she is still fiery-tempered and proud, there is a new gentleness in her. He also visits Lise, who has become extremely hysterical. She says she does not want to marry him, and often laughs and cries for no reason. She says she hates the world and wants to die. When he leaves, she slams the door on her finger and whispers, “I’m a vile, vile, vile (evil), creature.”
Alyosha meets Ivan, and tells Ivan that he knows that Ivan thinks that he is involved in the murder of his father, and says, “It was not you who killed father…it was not you, not you! God has sent me to tell you this.” Surprised and troubled, Ivan hurries angrily away.
Ivan has been visiting Smerdyakov, who keeps on saying he knows that Ivan secretly wanted Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov to die. Feeling worried and guilty, he goes to visit Katerina, who shows him a letter written by Dmitry when he was drunk, threatening to kill his father and get the 3,000 rubles. Ivan decides that Dmitry has killed his father, until he visits Smerdyakov again – and Smerdyakov openly admits that he killed Fyodor Pavlovich. Smerdyakov also says that he was able to do this because of Ivan’s ideas that “everything was allowed.” Ivan is horrified and so guilty he sees a devil that keeps on taunting him, and finally goes mad on the day Smerdyakov hangs himself.
The next day, the trial of Dmitry Karamazov opened in the court. Katerina tells the story of Dmitry helping her father and giving her money without saying anything bad about him. The clever lawyer, Fetyukovich, makes all the witnesses who think Dmitry is guilty look silly. Dmitry’s case seems to be going well until Ivan comes and says that he has murdered his father, which makes everybody confused. Then Katerina, horrified, jumps up and screams that Ivan is innocent, and shows everybody the letter Dmitry wrote to her, doing the very opposite of her first . Immediately after this she feels so guilty and sad for “betraying” Dmitry that she goes into hysterics. The prosecutor, Ippolit Kirrillovich, say that Dmitry is guilty, not crazy, and that he has done the worst sin – a son killing his own father. On the other hand, the lawyer Fetyukovich says that there is no real proof that Dmitry is guilty, and that Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov was never a real father to Dmitry; he also says that the only way for Dmitry to start a new life is to be set free. Almost everybody think Dmitry is innocent, feel sorry for him, and think he will be set free. However, the jury says he is guilty, and he is put into jail to wait for his to Siberia.
After the trial, Katerina takes Ivan to her house and nurses him. Alyosha asks her to see Dmitry, who has decided to escape, and she agrees. She goes to see Dmitry, and they forgive each other. Grushenka suddenly comes in and is shocked to see Katerina. Katerina asks her to forgive her, too, but Grushenka angrily says no. Katerina hurries away, and Alyosha, who has seen everything, goes to Ilyusha’s funeral – he has died. There, he says a speech to the schoolboys about love and forgiveness, asking them to remember this day always, and the book ends hopefully with the boys cheering, “Three cheers for Karamazov!”

Dostoevsky calls him the “hero” of "The Brothers Karamazov". At the beginning of the book, Dostoevsky describes him:
He is special because of his very deep faith in God, his unselfishness, and his love for all humans. He refuses (does not) to judge people, and often is very to other people’s feelings. He is gentle, modest (not proud), and very kind, but never foolish or naïve, and because of this almost everybody likes and trusts him. “The gift of making people love him was inherent in him; he gained people’s affection directly and effortlessly; it was part of his nature.” Dmitry calls him “the cherub”; Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov “…had come to love his son deeply and sincerely; in fact, his feelings for Alyosha were such as a man like him could never have expected to have for anyone.” He says to Alyosha, “…with you alone I feel like a decent person at certain moments…”, and that Alyosha is his “only true son…the only one I’m not afraid of.” Ivan says that he likes Alyosha because he has strong beliefs, and is one of the only people he talks really sincerely to. While Ivan is horrified at children’s sufferings and says that this is one of the reasons why he cannot believe in God, Alyosha actively helps and loves children, like Kolya and Ilyusha. He is almost a symbol of love and forgiveness, and represents the spiritual part of mankind. He influences the schoolboys and teaches them what Zosima taught him.
Also called: Dmitri, Mitka, Mitenka, Mitri Fyodorovich
He is described as “unruly as a boy and as a young man…irresponsible (not responsible), violent, passionate (with strong emotions), unruly, impatient…” He has Alyosha’s good heart, but his father’s sensuality. He is usually controlled by his strong emotions, like when he runs madly after Grushenka even after he had engaged with, and sincerely even loved, Katerina. He is a symbol of humans and their struggle between good and evil (bad), and more especially the bodily part of mankind. The prosecutor in the book says, "...Dmitry Karamazov represents Russia directly, as it is today...she is all there, our old mother Russia; we can smell her! Oh, like him, we are such a...sincere people; we are an amazing mixture of good and evil; we love enlightenment and Schiller, but we also love to rage and storm in and to tear out the beards of our drunken drinking companions." He becomes a better and stronger man in the end, and this shows the writer’s belief in hope for humankind.

The brother of Alyosha by the same mother, Sofia, Ivan is perhaps one of the most complicated characters in the story. He is an extremely clever student, (it is probable that he represents, in the novel, the intellectual part of mankind) and is proud and filled with doubt. Dmitry calls him “silent as the grave.” He cannot believe in God, or thinks that if God is real, he must be a very mean God who doesn’t care about humans. He says that “everything is possible” – there is no “good” or “bad.” However, he is disgusted at the life of his father, which logically is right according to his beliefs. He is too proud to follow his own happiness by acting on his own love for Katerina. His final madness shows the novel’s rejection of his beliefs. The sad problem with Ivan is that “his head is not in harmony with his heart”: with his feelings he loves God’s world, although with his reason he can’t accept it. Ivan has both a strong sense of justice, like Alyosha, and is unhappy at the suffering of children; but, unlike Alyosha, who actively makes friends with and helps children, Ivan does not do anything about it. It is unclear what will happen to him: but the novel ends so cheerfully it suggests he will probably find some way of spiritual .
The father of Dmitry, Ivan, Alyosha, and probably Smerdyakov. Lustful, vulgar, lying, coarse, and without caring about who he hurts, he is extremely selfish and cares only about his own desires. He is more afraid of Ivan than Dmitry, but he likes Alyosha, even though he likes to tease and scare him. He does not care much about his sons or his wives. Joyce Carol Oates describes him as "...a certain perverse (strange) blend (mix) of the and the spiritual, a brilliant comic creation who cannot sit down to drink without questioning the meaning of life." However, together with his lustfulness, there is a surprising simpleness in him: "As a general rule, people, even the wicked, are much more naive and simple-hearted than we suppose (think). And we ourselves are, too."
Also called: Grusha, Grushka
Betrayed when she was young by a lover, she comes to town and makes almost all the men in the town fall in love with her. Dmitry and Fyodor Karamazov both love her and hate each other because of her. The book says “…in all fairness, it must be said, she was very, very beautiful and her beauty was that typical Russian beauty which inspires (creates) passion in so many men…She was twenty-two and she looked exactly her age.” She is very clever, for instance, she saves up money very well, proud, and actually much purer than most people think. She likes to torture both Dmitry and his father for fun, to laugh at them, and to have revenge for the hurt she received from her first lover; she can also be quite , like when she lied to Katerina, hurting and insulting her. However, a hidden gentleness, sincerity, and kindness inside her opens up and begins to grow after she becomes friends with Alyosha. Alyosha said, “I expected to find a wicked soul…But instead I have found a true sister, a treasure, a loving soul…”
Silent, Smerdyakov is the son of an idiot woman named “Stinking Lizaveta,” which is where his name comes from. He was brought up by the servants, Martha and Gregory, and later became Fyodor Karamazov’s cook. He has epilepsy and is very mean, sometimes showing his evil openly, and sometimes pretending to be very humble and afraid. He sometimes plays the guitar to Maria, the landlady’s daughter. He has great respect for Ivan, and Ivan’s beliefs strongly influence his murder of Mr. Karamazov. He is Ivan's "shadow", and puts into action all Ivan's secret thoughts and wishes. He hangs himself later.
Smerdyakov is almost Ivan's "double" at times; when Alyosha asks him politely if he knows where Dmitry is, he replies coldly, "It's not as if I were his keeper" (p. 269). A few pages later, Ivan says, "'You are always harping upon it! What have I to do with it? Am I my brother Dmitri's keeper?' " (p. 275) Later, when Fyodor Pavlovich is drunkenly talking about how he made Alyosha's mother, Sofya, become unhappy by insulting her God, Ivan angrily reminds him that Sofya was his mother, too. Fyodor exclaims in surprise:
"Your mother?...What do you mean? What mother are you talking about? Was she?...Why, damn it! of course she was yours too!...Excuse me, why, I was thinking Ivan...He, he, he!" He stopped. A broad (wide), drunken, half senseless grin overspread his face. (p. 164)
It is possible that he was thinking that Ivan was Lizaveta's son - perhaps he even confused Ivan with Smerdyakov himself.
Also called: Katka, Katenka
An extremely proud, beautiful, and sensitive young woman who is Dmitry’s fiancée. She has a pale oval face, black eyes, and is very tall – even taller than Grushenka. She tries to pretend to be a martyr and by being very loyal and suffering a lot, wants everybody to see the evil of the people around her. She loves Ivan, but does not admit it, even to herself, until the end of the novel.
The kind, loving, “rather cheerful” and wise elder who is Alyosha’s and teacher before he dies. His real and goodness shows the faults of other people – even the very good Alyosha is embarrassed and awkward around Lise and his father, while Zosima is quiet, kind, and calm. He sees people clearly. Alyosha is influenced by his teachings and uses them to teach the schoolboys he becomes friends with. It is probable that his character was inspired by Saint Tikhon of Zadonsk. Dostoevsky wrote to poet A. Maikov, "To you alone I make this confession...I am going to portray (picture) the real Tikhon of Zadonsk, whom I long ago received into my heart with real delight." When he first wrote "The Brothers Karamazov", the name "Tikhon" was inside, and was later replaced by "Elder Zosima".
A rich lady in the town, a friend of the Karamazovs and Katerina. She is a bit selfish and , and worries very much about her daughter, Lise. She unknowingly what Elder Zosima seriously says about people being unable to judge each other, saying cheerfully about Dmitry,
"Let them acquit [Mitya]—that's so humane (kind), and would show what a blessing reformed (changed) law courts are...And if he is , make him come straight from the law courts to dinner with me, and I'll have a party of friends, and we'll drink to the reformed law courts. I don't believe he'd be dangerous; besides, I'll invite a great many friends, so that he could always be led out if he did anything. And then he might be made a justice of the peace or something in another town, for those who have been in trouble themselves make the best judges. And, besides, who isn't suffering...nowadays?" (p. 703)
Mrs. Khokhlakov’s pretty but mischievous and daughter. She is in love with Alyosha and becomes engaged to Alyosha, but decides not to marry him. She grows more and more hysterical and wishes to suffer. Though people like Dmitry become spiritually new because of their suffering, Lise’s “suffering” is silly and selfish – like when she tries to slam the door on her fingernail. Ivan says that he “likes Lise,” but is very contemptuous about that “hell kitten.”
A young student that Alyosha thinks of as his friend, but who secretly dislikes Alyosha. and sarcastic, he does not believe in God and likes to use fashionable philosophical theories, saying that he is a socialist and saying things that Nietzsche said. He is annoyed by Alyosha's real purity and tries to introduce him to Grushenka, hoping that she will shake his religious faith.
A brave, proud, and clever young boy who makes friends with Alyosha after Ilyusha becomes ill.
Inside The Brothers Karamazov, people struggle between religious faith and doubt. When Fyodor Karamazov asks, “Is there a God or not?” Ivan says, “No, there is no God.” Fyodor turns to Alyosha: “Alyosha, does God exist?” Alyosha firmly answers, “God does exist.” Dostoevsky writes in his book that a life of faith is higher, better, purer, and happier than a life of doubt, cold, hurting, and confusing. Zosima and Alyosha love humans and are a symbol of faith, while Dostoevsky shows that he thinks that doubt is bad by Ivan's madness and Smerdyakov's murder. Dostoevsky also shows in the chapter “The Grand Inquisitor” that though faith may not be able to be solved by logic, there is something in it deep, moving, and impossible to explain by words – like in Jesus and Alyosha’s kiss, or in Zosima's bowing down to the ground. It also searches about free will: Ivan says that free will is a heavy burden, while Zosima and Alyosha agree that free will is a joy and a gift of God to humans. Another important theme is that of forgiveness: Zosima says everyone must forgive and love, and Alyosha never judges or criticizes people. Zosima says that people should forgive each other freely, because people's sins are so connected with each other that everybody has some responsibility for each other, like when Dmitry, without thinking much about it, grabs Captain Snegriev's beard and pulls him, leading finally to Ilyusha's death. People like Ivan do not like this idea: he continues to that he does not have any responsibility for other people's sins, and when he finally is forced to accept it, he becomes insane.
Dmitry also, though he did not kill his father, at first wants to suffer to find peace and a new life. Both brothers feel guilty as if they were the ones who killed their father. Alyosha's strong sense of responsibility makes Elder Zossima tell him to "go out into the world", for he has work to do there. Dostoevsky thought that people should be "married" to the world around them, for, he argues, everyone is a part of God's creation.
The existence of God has concerned people for a long time: is there a God, or not? Dostoevsky thought there was.
He wrote in his books the two opposite sides of the question: from Ivan, the atheist intellectual's view, and the Elder Zosima's view. The author called the part in which Ivan and Elder Zosima each speak their beliefs as "the point of the novel" ("Letters", 7567, 859). Dostoevsky wrote in his notebook about "The Grand Inquisitor": "Those blockheads have never even conceived (thought of) so powerful a rejection of God as exists (is) in the Inquisitor and the preceding chapter (the chapter before it), to which the whole book will serve as answer. . . . Throughout Europe there has not been and does not exist so powerful an expression from the aesthetic point of view as mine."
In the book, Ivan's argument is that there is no justice in the world. He is very unhappy with the suffering of people on earth, and says: "I must have retribution (justice), or I will destroy myself. And not retribution in some remote (far away) infinite time and space, but here on earth, and that I could see myself." But there "is" no absolute justice in the world. So, Ivan says that there are only two things that can be true: either God is not real, or if He is real, He must be an unjust and unwise God.
Ivan has also not forgotten Jesus Christ. When Alyosha exclaims, "But...you asked whether there was in the world 'a single creature who could forgive'. Well, there is. And He can forgive everyone for everything, because He Himself gave His innocent blood for everyone's sins and for everyone's sake. You forgot to mention (talk about) Him..." Ivan replies by the story of "The Grand Inquisitor". In "The Grand Inquisitor", Ivan shows to Alyosha what he believes is the wrong of Jesus' rule, and a possibly better, "more just" one.
Readers immediately wrote letters to Dostoevsky after Book Five about "The Grand Inquisitor" was published in great worry, and Dostoevsky replied, "...my hero's blasphemy will be triumphantly refuted (replied to) in the next issue, on which I am now working with fear, trembling, and veneration, since I consider my task (job) . . . a deed." However, when Book Six, Dostoevsky's "answer" to "The Grand Inquisitor", was published, he was much more worried: ""I don't know whether I succeeded. I reckon myself that I wasn't able to express one tenth of what I wanted...I tremble for it in this sense: will it be answer enough? . . . I wrote it with a great deal of love." D.H. Lawrence felt that "we cannot doubt that the Inquisitor speaks Dostoevsky's own final opinion about Jesus."
The Elder Zosima's words before he dies is evidently Dostoevsky's "reply" to Ivan. Elder Zosima believes in a kind and just Jesus, who loves people very dearly and cares for them so much that he died for them.
About suffering, the Elder Zosima says that since God is kind and just, all the suffering comes from man. But since everyone's lives are connected, Elder Zosima says, we cannot blame anybody: "[A]ll is like an ocean, all is flowing and blending; a touch in one place sets up movement at the other end of the earth". Instead of demanding justice, he says everyone should begin changing and forgiving each other. Instead of saying, "nobody is guilty", he says, "everybody is responsible".
The pain of suffering, according to Elder Zosima, is a passing thing - it will not last. He refers to the Book of Job and says,
Though Dostoevsky wrote of Elder Zosima's reply as the reply of Ivan's arguments, he defends Christianity throughout the whole book and through the characters themselves. Elder Zosima is happy and respected, loved and loving, and dies peacefully and joyfully, but Ivan, who is so unhappy for the justice of humans, says, "I could never understand how one could love one's neighbor" and knocks a into the snow to freeze. "'He will freeze,' thought Ivan, and he went on his way". And at the end, his horror at the thought that he was, in a way, his father's murderer, drives him insane. Elder Zosima, however, is very different; he blesses and helps people even when he is dying, and "Alyosha almost always noticed that many, almost all, went in to the elder for the first time with apprehension (fear) and , but almost always came out with bright and happy faces". Even Ivan respects Father Zosima after meeting him and seriously "receive[s] his blessing, [and] kisse[s] his hand".
The narrator (person telling the story) is unnamed, and though he knows the coldness and darkness of the subjects he writes about, he writes warmly and inventively in a tone of serious comedy. Although the narrator is sometimes allowed to be , he also talks of himself as "I", says things that are not directly related to the plot, in a style that some people have criticized. It is possible that this writing style is because of the way Dostoevsky's books were written: in the day, he would hurriedly write down ideas in his notebook, and at night, his wife, Anna Snitkina Grigoryevna, who was a , would have them copied neatly out:
The critical reception of The Brothers Karamazov has been quite special and strong. Dostoevsky published his books in a series of journals, and every one made people argue about it and think very much about it. Sigmund Freud called it “the most magnificent novel ever written.” Franz Kafka was greatly influenced by Dostoevsky’s works.
Critic Robin Feuer Miller wrote that "The Brothers Karamazov" was Dostoevsky's "...last and arguably greatest novel."
Virginia Woolf said, "Alone among writers Dostoevsky has the power of reconstructing(making again) those most swift(quick) and complicated states of mind... This is the exact opposite of the method(way) adopted(used), perforce(for instance), by most of our novelists. They reproduce all the external(outside) appearances-tricks of manner, landscape, dress, and the effect of the hero upon his friends-but very rarely, and only for an instant, penetrate to the of thought which rages within his own mind. But the whole of a book by Dostoevsky is made out of such material... We have to get rid of the old tune which runs so persistently (continues) in our ears and to realize how little of our is expressed in that old tune."
On 7 June, 1880, on the night before his famous "Pushkin speech", he wrote at midnight to his wife: "As I walked across the hall during intermission, a host of people, youths and graybeards and ladies, rushed toward me exclaiming, 'You're our prophet. We've become better people since we read The Karamazovs.' (In brief, I realized how tremendously important The Karamazovs is.)" The next evening, after the triumph of his speech, he wrote to her, "When I appeared on the stage, the auditorium thundered with applause... I bowed and made signs, begging them to let me read-but to no avail(no use): elation(joy), enthusiasm (all because of The Karamazovs)!"
However, not everybody loved "The Brothers Karamazov". Tchaikovsky, an important writer of music in Russia, was interested in "The Brothers Karamazov", but finally decided that it was "" and that all the characters were "crazy". Some people, like Henry James, Vladimir Nabokov and D. H. Lawrence were very critical of it (did not like it). For example, Lawrence said that in "The Brothers Karamazov", he did not like "these Russians, morbidly wallowing (swimming) in adoration (love) of Jesus, then getting up and spitting in His beard... It's all , half-baked, and one gets tired of it. One gets tired of being told that Dostoevsky's Legend of the "Grand Inquisitor" 'is the most profound (deepest) declaration which ever was made about man and life.' ... The more Dostoevsky gets worked up (excited) about the tragic (sad) nature of the human soul, the more I lose interest. I have read the "Grand Inquisitor" three times, and never can remember what it's really about." He also said "The Brothers Karamazov" was too depressing "because, alas, more drearily true to life. At first it had been lurid romance. Now I read "The Grand Inquisitor" once more, and my heart sinks right through my shoes."

July Revolution

The French Revolution of 1830, also known as the July Revolution, was the throwing off of Charles X of France from power. His cousin Louis-Philippe, the Duc d'Orléans became king. However, after 18 hard years on the throne, he, also, would be taken off the position of king. It showed the change from one kind of monarchy to another. This change was from the Bourbon Restoration to the July Monarchy. This also marked the change of power from the House of Bourbon to the House of Orléans. People who supported Bourbon would be called Legitimists. Supporters of Louis-Phillipe were called Orleanists. Louis-Philippe was king of the French (not King of France) until the French Revolution of 1848.
On September 16, 1824, Charles X came to the throne of France. He was the younger brother of Louis XVIII. When Napoléon Bonaparte was defeated, he had become King of France. Both Louis and Charles ruled because of their birth, not because a great number of people wanted them to. This was the first of two things that began "Les Trois Glorieuses", the "Three Glorious Days" of the July Revolution.
When Napoleon in 1814, Europe, and mostly France, was in great confusion. The Congress of Vienna met to draw the continent's political map again. A great number of European countries came to the congress. However, there were four most important powers that controlled the decision. These powers were the United Kingdom, Austria, Russia, and Prussia, represented by King Frederick William III. Another very important person at the Congress was Charles Maurice de Talleyrand. He was a French under Napoleon. France was considered an enemy state.
Talleyrand suggested that Europe go back to its first, "legitimate" government. He meant the government before Napoleon. This plan was largely accepted by members of the Congress. France went back to its 1789 borders and the House of Bourbon came back to the throne. In the eyes of the Congress, the political situation in France and Europe was now back to normal. However, the new king, Louis XVIII, felt that ideas of nationalism and democracy were still in his country. So, they made and signed the "Charte constitutionnelle française", the French Constitution. It is also known as "La Charte". This was the second thing that began the July Revolution.
People quickly learned about the Saint-Cloud "ordonnances" from the "Le Moniteur". Angrily, workers were fired, and business closed down. Unemployment, which had been growing through early summer, increased. "Large numbers of... workers therefore had nothing to do but protest."
Newspapers such as the "Journal des débats", "Le Moniteur Universel (Le Moniteur)", and "Le Constitutionnel" had already stopped being put in print. This was because of the new law. Almost 50 journalists from 12 city newspapers met in the offices of the liberal "Le National". There they signed a protest, and promised their newspapers would continue to run.
That evening, police came to a news press and took away newspapers that were against the law. An angry, unemployed mob shouted hotly, ""A bas les Bourbons!" "Vive la Charte!!"" Armand Carrel, a Republican journalist, wrote in the "Le National":
"France... falls back into revolution by the act of the government itself... the legal regime is now interrupted, that of force has begun... in the situation in which we are now placed obedience has ceased to be a duty... It is for France to judge how far its own resistance ought to extend."
As if living in a dream world, the Paris "Préfet de Police" wrote on the evening, " ...the most perfect tranquility (peace) continues to reign (rule) in all parts of the capital. No event ... of attention is recorded in the reports that have come through to me."

<doc id="220186" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=220186" title="Baja Bug">
Baja Bug

A Baja Bug is an original Volkswagen Beetle changed so that it can operate in open desert, sand dunes and beaches. Other kinds of air-cooled Volkswagens are sometimes changed this way.
Baja Bugs were first made in Southern California in the late 1960s as an inexpensive answer to the commercial-built, Volkswagen-based dune buggies of the mid-1960s, especially the Meyers Manx.
The first Baja Bug may have been built by Gary Emory of Parts Obsolete in or around 1968. The first racing Baja Bug is credited to automotive cartoonist Dave Deal, whose car was raced in the Mexican 1000 of 1968. The first fiberglass body kit was introduced in 1969 by the Miller-Havens company.
In the days before fiberglass body parts, builders simply changed a stock VW. The car's metal body parts were partially cut away to allow more ground clearance and suspension travel. This came to be known as a "cut baja". More engine power was had by using cylinder heads and sometimes even fuel injection systems from VW Type 3 cars.
The Beetle was popular in places with few roads because of its rear-mounted air-cooled engine, flat floorpan, and torsion bar suspension. In fact, magazine advertising of the time said that the Beetle was so watertight it floated. These good things made the Beetle the perfect choice to make into an off-road car. It was successful both then and now in the Baja 1000 off-road race.
Basic changes are simple. Lightweight fiberglass body panels are fitted after the metal body parts front and rear are removed. The rear change leaves the engine totally open to aid in cooling. Tubular steel bumpers are fitted to the body and floorpan to protect the engine and those riding in the car. Shortened fiberglass fenders and sometimes more tubular steel parts are added to the car's sides. The torsion bar front and rear suspensions made it easy to raise the body and to allow the use of large off-road tires and wheels as well as longer shock absorbers. Some people even get rid of the torsion bar suspension and install coilover-type springs that mount to a roll cage. This kind of car would have lots of suspension travel and a smooth ride.
Though few Baja Bugs are built anymore since the creation of tube-framed, purpose-built buggies known as sand rails and the shrinking supply of early Volkswagens, they remain a popular choice in the desert since few beaches in the US are open to for use by cars or motorcycles. Many are fitted with highly modified Volkswagen engines and a few have engines from such cars as the Ford Pinto, Chevrolet Corvair, Porsche, Mazda, Subaru or other four- to eight-cylinder water-cooled engines. Fancy Baja Bugs for use only on roads remain popular as well.
Volkswagen itself created a concept car in 2000 called "Dune" and was meant to remind people of the Baja Bug.

Comparative anatomy

Comparative anatomy is the scientific comparison of animal bodies. The purpose of comparative anatomy is to see their working structure, and to decide upon the phylogenetic relationships between different groups of animals. The separation of animals into phyla is done mainly by comparative anatomy: see List of animal phyla.
The main techniques used are dissection and microscopy. Dissection is an ancient method used to find out the inside structure of a living thing (usually done after it is dead). It is still used by medical students to learn about the details of the human body. Simple microscopes were first invented in the 17th century, and the compound microscope (still used today) became available in the 19th century. The purpose of microscopy is to let us see the small details of structure. Also, the careful comparison of large collections of animals (usually in museums) is often done.
The great era of comparative anatomy was from about 1800 to about 1950. It was used by those who did not believe in evolution, such as Georges Cuvier, and by those who did, such as Thomas Henry Huxley. Charles Darwin himself used comparative anatomy as the main tool in his work on barnacles. Nowadays, the main method used to find out relationships is molecular evolution, which uses DNA sequence analysis. However, for many research purposes, zoologists still dissect animals. To get a degree in biology, you need to know about the structure of animals (and plants).

Dissection

Dissection is a standard laboratory technique in biology and pathology. To dissect is to cut up a body so as to reveal its structure. The body could be that of a human, an animal, or a plant. Dissections are regularly done in autopsies to help determine the cause of death. They are done by zoologists to find out the internal structure of animal bodies. The comparative anatomy of animals, revealed by dissections, gives clues as to their evolutionary relationships.

<doc id="220225" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=220225" title="List of animal phyla">
List of animal phyla

List of animal phyla is a list of the major groups of animals usually classified as a phylum. Modern sources have been used: the list is different from that of Linnaeus or Cuvier. A list of this type may be arranged alphabetically; but equally it might be arranged according to evolutionary relationships. No list will be completely satisfactory. Authorities differ in what they consider a phylum, and in the actual name of the phylum. Despite this, there is agreement on most phyla. Most modern surveys include groups above the phylum: superphyletic groupings based on evidence of common descent. 
Differences of opinion about evolutionary relationships have been reduced by the use of molecular evolution and molecular clock research. These make use of protein amino acid sequences, and whole genome DNA sequence analysis. These modern techniques have led to changes and renaming of many higher categories. Classification based on traditional comparative anatomy had errors which needed to be corrected. So, for example, the old phylum Coelenterata, which had stood for almost two hundred years, was split down into two separate phyla, the Cnidaria and the Ctenophora.
The following list is based on evolutionary relationships:
Major groups in large type.
Depending on how one counts, the list contains 32 (or 39) phyla of metazoan animals. Of these, 20 are minor phyla, and at least 21 are exclusively aquatic, with several others in quasi-aquatic habitats on land. "None" are entirely terrestrial. This is testimony to the importance of water for life, and to the sea in particular. It is fairly certain that all phyla originated in the sea or, at any rate, in water. Most made their first showing in the Cambrian, or in the Ediacaran. Naturally, most of the soft-bodied phyla have left few fossils.
Phyla may be grouped according to evidence about their evolutionary relationships. The list above puts similar groups together.
This kind of megataxonomy is becoming more convincing as DNA sequence analysis proceeds through the phyla. Some entirely fossil groups are still placed where they are on anatomy and commonsense rather than hard molecular evidence. The trilobites are a good example. Their position in the Arthropoda is based on not much more than their bilateral symmetry and an exoskeleton. These groupings are discussed further in the references to this page.
This table has the advantage of being sortable. The terminology differs in places from the above descriptions. Also, by listing living species only for most phyla, those with huge fossil records (like Bryozoa and Brachiopods) are lower in the order despite being important aquatic forms in the Palaeozoic era.
This list is to help when you read older literature which may use out-of-date terms.

<doc id="220230" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=220230" title="Orthoptera">
Orthoptera

Orthoptera are an order of insects. The order contains grasshoppers, katydids, and crickets. "Ortho" means "straight", so "Orthoptera" means "straight wings".
This means the front wings, called "tegmina", are stiff, straight, and not used for flying. The back wings are membranous and are folded like a fan under the front wings when the insect is not flying. Many species use their wings to make sounds, which we usually call "chirping" noises.
Orthopteran insects start life in an egg case. After three weeks – or when spring comes – the tiny nymphs come out from the egg case. After four or five molts, they have wings. This shows that they are adults and are ready to reproduce.
Their sounds are produced by using file-like edges to their wings, or wing veins. In some groups the wing edges are rubbed together, in others the hind limb is rubbed aginst a wing edge. Each sound is unique to the species, and its function is identification for mating purposes. It is males which make the sound, and females move towards it.
In the order Orthoptera, members chew their food, using their mandibles (jaws). Crickets are omnivores, which means they eat both plants and animals. Actually, they will eat almost anything: vegetables, cereal, and even their own mate if they are hungry enough. Katydids are mostly herbivores (plant eaters), though they will eat their own mate, too, if "they" are hungry enough. They also enjoy eating aphids and other small, slow-moving creatures. Grasshoppers almost always eat plants like grass, wheat bran, and lettuce, and they can be terrible crop pests.
It's quite hard to catch a member of Orthoptera because they jump so well. They have amazing legs - a grasshopper can jump 20 times farther than the length of its body. Their back legs are very large and long. These long, strong legs give these insects their great ability to jump.
Crickets, katydids, and grasshoppers are in the same order of Orthoptera because they are alike in many ways. However, there are several things that make them different from each other.
First, their colors are usually quite different. Since grasshoppers like to move during the daytime, their colors are similar to grass and bright flowers, making them usually green, light brown, or multicolored (lots of different colors at once). Crickets move at night, so they are dark. Katydids like to spend a lot of time on leaves, so they are often leaf-colored, and their wings can look like leaves. Their wings can have the same vein patterns as leaves, and they often have little brown spots just like the ones that might be found on a leaf.
Secondly, their behaviors are different. Grasshoppers like being active in the day; crickets, at night; katydids, in the late afternoon and evening.
Thirdly, their antennae is different. Katydids and crickets usually have long, thin antennae, while grasshoppers usually have short, thick ones. Of course, this rule does is "not" perfect – for instance, even though grasshoppers "usually" have short, thick antennae, the long-horned grasshopper has long, thin antennae like a cricket. Because of this, it is still sometimes hard to tell the members of this order apart.

Norman Jay Coleman

Norman Jay Coleman (May 16, 1827 – November 3, 1911) was a newspaper publisher and the first United States Secretary of Agriculture. 
Coleman was born in Richfield Springs, New York in 1827 to Hamilton and Nancy Coleman. He received a law degree from the University of Louisville Law School in 1849. Coleman then moved to Missouri and went into farming. In 1855 he started the "Valley Farmer" newspaper. As a result of the newspaper, Coleman became an important person in the Missouri farming community, which helped him become a member of the Missouri House of Representatives. Coleman’s newspaper stopped due to the American Civil War, but three years after the war he started the "Coleman’s Rural World". His career in politics continued when he was made the Lieutenant Governor of Missouri from 1875 to 1877. During that time he worked to make United States Department of Agriculture a cabinet-level department. Under the administration of President Grover Cleveland, he served as its first Secretary. His position as Secretary of Agriculture was never confirmed by the United States Senate.
He was a member of the Freemasons.

Jeremiah McLain Rusk (June 17, 1830 – November 21, 1893) was the 15th Governor of the U.S. state of Wisconsin from 1882 to 1889.
Rusk was born in Malta, Ohio. He was a member of the Republican Party. He began his life as a farmer, then became an innkeeper and finally became a banker before the Civil War. During the war, he received a brevet appointment as a general and saw action with the 25th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry.
After the Civil War, he became a congressman in the United States House of Representatives. There, he became chairman of the Committee on Invalid Pensions. He was elected Governor of Wisconsin as a Republican in 1882. His most noted act during his governorship was when he sent the National Guard into Milwaukee to keep the peace during the May Day Labor Strikes of 1886. This led to the Bay View Tragedy, in which a number of workers were killed; Governor Rusk took most of the blame.
In 1889 he resigned his post as governor and accepted the new cabinet position of Secretary of Agriculture in the Benjamin Harrison administration. He lived, died and was buried in Viroqua, Wisconsin.

The Na'vi language is a language that was made for the Na'vi in the 2009 film "Avatar". It is an invented language. This means a person created it; no one grows up speaking it. Only one person can really speak the Na'vi language. One website has been known to help people learn Na'vi.
The first Na'vi words were made by the professor Paul Frommer in 2005 for the film. When they released the movie in 2009, the vocabulary increased to a thousand words despite the understanding of its grammar was limited to the language's creator.
Many people are learning the language. Websites like "Learn Na'vi" have many learning materials and a forum to learn with others.

Delgadillo's Snow Cap Drive-In

Delgadillo's Snow Cap Drive-In is a historic small restaurant and roadside attraction along a part of what used to be Route 66 in Seligman, Arizona USA. The drive-in was built in 1953 by a man who lived in the town, Juan Delgadillo (May 17, 1916 - June 2, 2004). Delgadillo had very little money, so he built the restaurant mostly from scrap lumber he found at the nearby Santa Fe Railroad yard.
Delgadillo thought of a fun way to bring attention to his new restaurant. He cut the roof off of a 1936 Chevrolet, put paint, horns and emblems from other cars all over it and placed an artificial Christmas tree in the rear of the car.
Delgadillo's had a sense of humor which could be seen both on his car and on his menu. That menu still has such choices as a "cheeseburger with cheese" and "dead chicken." "Juan's Garden" at the rear of the restaurant is just as funny. That is the place Mr. Delgadillo kept his collection of old cars and other strange things. Even the building itself has strange and funny things written on it. Hand-painted signs in the parking area warn drivers that they are "parking at their own risk." A neon sign in the window tells people, "Sorry, we're open." The door which leads inside has two knobs, one on the right and one on the left. The knob on the right is fake; the one on the left opens the door. Delgadillo would have fun with his customers by asking, for example, if they wanted cheese on their cheeseburgers.
While learning about the history of Route 66 for the 2006 Disney/Pixar motion picture "Cars", John Lasseter met Delgadillo's brother, Seligman barber and Route 66 expert, Angel Delgadillo, who told him how traffic through the town almost completely went away on the day that nearby Interstate 40 opened.
Since Delgadillo's death in 2004, the Snow Cap has been run by his sons John-Michael and Robert. They both work the counter and play with the customers like their father did. The walls around the counter area itself are covered with business cards from all over the world.
Author Michael Wallis covers the history of the Snow Cap in his book, "Route 66: The Mother Road."

Brachiopod

Brachiopods are a phylum of small marine shellfish, sometimes called lampshells. They are not common today, but in the Palaeozoic they were one of the most common types. They lived near the shore (littoral zone), but now they have been pushed into deeper water by competition from bivalve molluscs.
At their peak in the Palaeozoic era the brachiopods occupied a number of marine ecological niches. They were among the most abundant filter-feeders and reef-builders. Many sat on the sea floor, but some swam in the jet-propulsion style of scallops. Brachiopod fossils have been useful indicators of climate changes during the Paleozoic era. 
They do look rather like bivalves, but their internal organisation is quite different. Their mostly calcium carbonate shells or "valves" have upper and lower surfaces, unlike the left and right arrangement in bivalve molluscs. Brachiopod valves are hinged at the rear end. The front can be opened for feeding or closed for protection. 
Two major groups are recognized, articulate and inarticulate. Articulate brachiopods have toothed hinges and simple opening and closing muscles, while inarticulate brachiopods have untoothed hinges and a more complex system of muscles used to fit the two halves together. In a typical brachiopod a stalk-like pedicle goes from an opening in one of the valves (the pedicle valve). It attaches the animal to the seabed but clear of silt that would obstruct the opening.
Brachiopods have a huge fossil record going back to the Cambrian. They were much reduced by the two main extinction events, the P/Tr and K/T. Bivalve molluscs took over their inshore habitats in the Mesozoic, and since then the brachiopods have been confined to deeper water, except for a handful of species. There are about 100 to 350 species living; the fossil species number 12,000.
"Lingula", one of the oldest genera of brachiopods, has survived from the earliest Ordovician to the present day. The various species look very similar, and the genus is a good example of a living fossil.
Brachiopod classification is being debated by invertebrate palaeontologists.

Medical school

A medical school is a place where medical students learn medicine. When they graduate from a medical school, they become a physician or a doctor. Medical Schools grant Doctor of Medicine (MD), Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) and sometimes Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Degrees. Students take classes in human biology and disease then take a license exam to practice medicine.
A medical student or student doctor is a person who has been accepted to a medical school and is studying to become a doctor. Medical students are typically required to learn about basic health, science, technology and the clinical practice of medicine. During basic technology study, most medical students learn about human anatomy, physiology, diseases, and different drugs.
Medical students are generally considered to be at the earliest stage of the medical career pathway. In some locations they are required to be registered with a government body.
Medical students typically engage in both basic science and practical clinical coursework during their tenure in medical school. Course structure and length vary greatly among countries.

Star Trek: The Original Series

Star Trek is a science fiction television series created by Gene Roddenberry that aired from September 8, 1966 to September 2, 1969. Though the original series was just called "Star Trek", it got the nickname Star Trek: The Original Series ("ST:TOS" or "TOS") to make it different from the spinoffs, and from the "Star Trek" universe or franchise they take up. Set in the 23rd century, the first "Star Trek" follows the adventures of the starship USS Enterprise (NCC-1701) and its crew, led by Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner), his First Officer Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy), and his Chief Medical Officer Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley). William Shatner's voice-over introduction during each episode's opening credits stated the starship's purpose:
When "Star Trek" first came on NBC in 1966, it was not successful to begin; ratings were low and advertising revenue was very little. Even at the end of the first season of "Star Trek", there were already calls in the network to cancel the series due to its low Nielsen ratings. Bay Area "Creature Features" host John Stanley in his memoir "I Was a TV Horror Host" relates how Desilu head Lucille Ball at that time "single handedly" kept "Star Trek" from being removed from the NBC-TV lineup."
Close to the end of the second season the show was still in danger of being canceled. Its fans succeeded in giving it a third season; but NBC moved the show to the "Friday night death slot" at 10 PM. "Star Trek" was finally canceled at the end of the third season, making 79 episodes in total. However, this was enough for the show to be stripped in syndication, allowing it to become very popular and gather a large cult following during the 1970s. After the success of the program, five additional television series and eleven movies, including the newest movie "Star Trek", which came out in May 2009. "Guinness World Records" lists the original "Star Trek" as having more spin-offs than any other television show in history.

Popularity

Popularity is the state of being well-liked or well-known. Popularity figures are an important part of many people's personal value systems, and forms a critical part of success in fields such as Management, politics, and the Entertainment Industry, among others.
Many different varieties of popularity exist, and many ways in which to gain it. General popularity usually involves respect in two ways: a popular person is respected by groups of people and will take that respect. This reinforces the idea that the person deserves the popularity. Likewise, amicability (friendliness) is an important part of popularity, as a person who does not like others is unlikely to be liked by others. This inverse nature of interpersonal popularity is often overlooked by people (particularly the young) who are attempting to become popular: being loud may be successful in gaining attention, but is unlikely to provide mutual respect.

<doc id="220520" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=220520" title="Argument from design">
Argument from design

The argument from design is an argument for the existence of God or a creator. According to the argument, the appearance of design in nature is evidence for the existence of God. The argument is teleological, because it assumes a purpose. The word "teleological" comes from the Ancient Greek "telos", which means "end" or "purpose".
Teleology assumes there is purpose or direction in the works and processes of nature. Immanuel Kant called this argument the physico–theological proof.
Most of the classic forms of this argument are linked to monotheism. Simply talking about a "designer", gives the following, simple formulation.
A concise and whimsical teleological argument was offered by G. K. Chesterton in 1908: "So one elephant having a trunk was odd; but all elephants having trunks looked like a plot."
Socrates (c. 469-399 B.C.) He argued that the adaptation of human parts to one another, such as the eyelids protecting the eyeballs, could not have been due to chance and was a sign of wise planning in the universe.
Plato (c. 427–c. 347 B.C.) posited a "demiurge" of supreme wisdom and intelligence as the creator of the cosmos in his work "Timaeus". For him, the "demiurge" lacked the supernatural ability to create "ex nihilo" or out of nothing. The demiurge was able only to organize the "ananke" (αναγκη). The ananke was the only other co-existent element or presence in Plato's cosmogony. Plato's teleological perspective is also built upon the analysis of "a priori" order and structure in the world that he had already presented in "The Republic".
Aristotle (c. 384–322 B.C.) also developed the idea of a creator of the cosmos, often referred to as the "Prime Mover" in his work "Metaphysics". Aristotle's views have very strong aspects of a teleological argument, specifically that of a prime mover, who (so to speak) looks ahead in setting the cosmos into motion. Indeed, Aristotle argued that all nature reflects inherent purposiveness and direction.
Cicero (c. 106–c. 43 B.C.) also made one of the earliest known teleological arguments. In "de Natura Deorum (On the Nature of the Gods)" Cicero stated, "The divine power is to be found in a principle of reason that pervades the whole of nature". He was writing from the cultural background of the Roman religion. In Roman mythology the creator goddess, Gaia was borrowed from Greek mythology. The Romans called her Tellus or Terra.
Augustine of Hippo (A.D. 354–430) presented a classic teleological perspective in his work "City of God". He describes the "city of man" and essentially posits that God's plan is to replace the city of man with the city of God (at some as-yet-unknown point in the future). Whether this is to happen gradually or suddenly is not made clear in Augustine's work. He did not, however, make a formal argument for the existence of God; rather, God's existence is already presumed and Augustine is giving a proposed view of God's teleology. Augustine's perspective follows from and is built upon the "neo-Platonic" views of his era, which in turn have their original roots in Plato's cosmogony.
The idea is that one can infer the existence of intelligent design by looking at an object. The teleological argument says that because life is complex, it must have been designed. It is argued that this is non-sequitur logic. Life or objects are described as "orderly" or "ordered", which shows that an intelligent designer has ordered them. However, in real life, there are examples of systems that are non-random or ordered simply because it is following natural physical processes, for example diamonds or snowflakes.
The design claim is often challenged as an argument from ignorance, since it is often unexplained or unsupported, or explained by unscientific conjecture. Supporters of design assume that natural objects and man-made objects have similar properties, therefore both must be designed. However, different objects can have similar properties for different reasons, such as stars and light bulbs. Proponents must therefore demonstrate that "only" design can cause orderly systems or the argument is invalid.
A designed organism would, on the face of it, be in contradiction to evolutionary theory. Most biologists support the idea of evolution, by means of natural selection. They therefore reject the first premise, arguing that evolution is not only an alternative explanation for the complexity of life but a better explanation with more supporting evidence. Living organisms obey the same physical laws as inanimate objects. A range of chemical reactions could take place, forming other chemicals with complex properties and ways of interacting. Over very long periods of time self-replicating structures could arise and later form DNA. This has in fact been demonstrated artificially via the Avida program, which can construct complex programs without being given any design (similar programs have had similar results with building machines). Biologists therefore commonly view the design argument as an unimpressive argument for the existence of a god.
Another argument states that even if the argument from design proved the existence of a powerful intelligent designer, it would not prove that the designer is God. Voltaire observed in his "Traité de métaphysique":
... from this sole argument I cannot conclude anything further than that it is probable that an intelligent and superior being has skillfully prepared and fashioned the matter. I cannot conclude from that alone that this being has made matter out of nothing and that he is infinite in every sense.
David Hume pointed out that the argument does not necessarily lead to the existence of one God. In his Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, the character Philo argued (p. 108), amidst other counterarguments to the teleological argument, "why may not several deities combine in contriving and framing the world?"
Critics such as Richard Dawkins often argue that the teleological argument would in turn apply to the proposed designer, arguing any designer must be at least as complex and purposeful as the designed object (in Dawkins' words, "The Ultimate 747", a reference to Hoyle's analogy to a windstorm sweeping through a junkyard and constructing a 747). This, they say, would create the absurdity of an infinite series of designers.
Whilst the Universe can at first seem be purposeful and ordered, it has been asserted that upon closer inspection its true function becomes questionable. Some scientists such as Richard Dawkins, a high-profile advocate of atheism, reject the claim that the Universe serves any actual function, claiming that the Universe merely 'mimics' purpose. For example, predators appear perfectly 'designed' to catch their prey, whilst their prey seem equally well 'designed' to evade them. Likewise, apparent inconsistencies in the design of organisms have been brought to attention by critics of the teleological argument. Some use such arguments to point towards natural selection as a 'blind' biological designer, as opposed to God.
Proponents of teleology have argued against this objection on various grounds. For example, William A. Dembski says that such arguments are based upon presumptions about what a designer would or would not do, and so constitute a "theological rather than scientific claim." "Not knowing the designer," he continues, they "are in no position to say whether the designer proposed a faulty compromise among those [design] objectives." (Dembski 2004, pp. 58–9)
Additionally, the claim of an apparent inconsistency between the "design" of predators and prey ignores the balance of the ecosystem. Dembski counters, "In criticizing design, [critics] tend to place premium on functionalities of individual organisms and see design as optimal to the degree that those individual functionalities are maximized. But higher-order designs of entire ecosystems might require lower-order designs of individual organisms." (Dembski, 2004, p. 61)
George H. Smith, in his book "Atheism: The Case Against God", points out what he considers to be a fatal flaw in the argument from design 
Consider the idea that nature itself is the product of design. How could this be demonstrated? Nature, as we have seen, provides the basis of comparison by which we distinguish between designed objects and natural objects. We are able to infer the presence of design only to the extent that the characteristics of an object differ from natural characteristics. Therefore, to claim that nature as a whole was designed is to destroy the basis by which we differentiate between artifacts and natural objects. Evidences of design are those characteristics "not" found in nature, so it is impossible to produce evidence of design "within" the context of nature itself. Only if we first step beyond nature, and establish the existence of a supernatural designer, can we conclude that nature is the result of conscious planning. (p. 268)

Na'vi

The Na'vi are a fictional indigenous species that live on the fictional world of Pandora in the movie Avatar. They look like humans, having pairs of eyes, ears, arms, and legs, as well as a nose, a mouth, and expressions that are similar to humans. The Na'vi differ by having blue skin, pointed ears, huge eyes, and tails. They are also taller but also have more narrow proportions in body frame. The Na'vi were meant to be more alien in their looks. Director James Cameron said that when one of the main characters, "Neytiri", was first drawn, she had fins, gills, and cat-like features. The species was redesigned to look more like humans, so audiences could relate to them better. Cameron said that "Avatar" was more "science fantasy" than true science fiction, and said that he would explain in the novel why the Na'vi look like humans.
According to "Entertainment Weekly", "The Na'vi can commune with animals on their planet by literally plugging their ponytails into the creatures' nerve systems. To become a warrior, a Na'vi must tame and ride a creature known as Ikran." The Na'vi also use this neural bonding system to mate with a "life partner" - a bond that, when made, cannot be broken in the Na'vi's lifetime.
The Na'vi language, a constructed language, was made for the movie to be spoken by the actors when they played Na'vi characters. The Na'vi language was made by linguistics professor Paul Former of the University of Southern California. Frommer designed the language so it could be spoken by human actors. It combines syntax and grammar from real languages. The professor made up over 1,000 words for the Na'vi language and taught the actors who played Na'vi characters to speak it for the movie.

Renault F1

Renault F1 is a Formula One racing team. It was once owned by the Renault company. In December of 2010, Renault sold their remaining part of the Formula One team. Renault has a long history in F1. Ferenc Szisz won the first French Grand Prix at the wheel of a Renault. Since then Renault has competed in Formula One as an engine supplier and as a builder from the late 1970s to the present day, with many breaks. Renault introduced the turbo engine to Formula One when they debuted their first car, the Renault RS01 at Silverstone in 1977. Although the Renault team won races and competed for world titles, it was as a supplier of engines to the Benetton and Williams teams in the 1990s that Renault first tasted world championship success. Renault Engines powered drivers such as Nigel Mansall, Damon Hill, Jacque Villeneuve and Michael Schumacer to the Drivers World Championship. 
Renault returned to the job of being a builder in 2001 by taking over the Benetton team, which was renamed Renault in 2002. Their first championship as a builder was achieved in 2005; the same year that they won their first drivers' championship with former test driver Fernando Alonso. They repeated their success in the following year. 
The teams lowest point so far was in late 2009. at the end of the 2008 season the team saw a brief return to the podium spots, with Fernando Alonso winning 2 of the last 4 races. However, Nelson Piquet Jnr, Who had drove for Renualt throughout the 2008 season (but was sacked from the team) told the media that the team had made him cheat in order to help Alonso win.
At the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix (the first ever Grand Prix to be held at night) Nelson Piquet Jnr lost control of his car at the outside of Turn 17, sliding across the road and smashing into a wall, throwing lots of debris across the road, meaning the Safety Car had to be called out to lead the cars through the track slowly to protect the Marshalls cleaning the road. This closed the gaps between the cars, meaning they were now racing very close together. This allowed Fernando Alonso, who was in 15th place to pass the slower less experienced drivers around him. Alonso went on to win race. 
After Renualt fired Piquet Jnr for his poor driving in 2009, He told the FIA (the organisation that run the Formula 1 World Championship) That Flavio Briatore, the Boss of the Renualt F1 Team (Who had been the boss for 20 years, and had cheated previously) had told him over the radio to crash the car deliberately, in order to bring the safety car out and give Alonso a better chance. Alonso was not aware of this at the time, or before to the crash.
Following a meeting of the FIA Super Council in Paris, Team Principle Flavio Briatore and Chief Engineer Pat Symmonds were found guilty. Both had to leave the team and Flavio was banned from Formula 1 for life (That band has now been lifted). In connection with the event, Renault F1's main Sponsor ING Insurance (as shown in the photo above) Also left the team
On 8 December, 2010, Renault announced that they had sold their remaining ownership shares in the team to Genii Capital, a private investment group. Those shares will be purchased by Lotus Cars, which is owned by Proton. Proton owns Lotus Cars. The team will be named Lotus Renault GP for 2011. They will continue to use Renault as the chassis name. The cars will use a black and gold livery (paint scheme). It will be similar to the historic "John Player Special" sponsorship that Lotus had in the 1970s and 1980s.
The team has raced as a French team since Renault took over Benetton in 2002. In January 2011, it was announced that they will race under a British licence in . This is the first time since that there has not been a French team in Formula One.

Mojito

A mojito is a kind of cocktail. It is from Cuba originally. It is made of rum, sugar, lime juice, sparkling water and mint. It usually contains about 10 percent alcohol. The combination of sweetness, sour citrus and mint flavour is intended to complement the rum. It is popular drink in hot weather.
When making a mojito, lime juice is added to sugar and mint leaves. The mixture is then gently mashed together. The mint leaves should only be bruised to release the essential oils; they should not be torn apart. Then rum is added. The mixture is then stirred to dissolve the sugar. Finally, ice cubes and sparkling water are added in the top of the drink. Mint leaves and lime wedges are used to garnish the glass.
There are several stories about how the mojito was invented. One story says that it is similar to a 19th-century drink called "El Draque", after Francis Drake. This drink is said to have been given to the crew of Drake's ships when they came to Cuba in the 16th century. Many in the crew were suffering from dysentery and scurvy. They were told that the Native Americans had remedies for various tropical illnesses. They went ashore on Cuba and were given ingredients for a remedy: a kind of rum, lime, sugarcane syrup and mint. While this drink was not called a mojito at this time, it is the same combination of these ingredients.

<doc id="220585" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=220585" title="Edmontosaurus">
Edmontosaurus

Edmontosaurus was a large, plant-eating, duck-billed dinosaur from the latest Cretaceous stage. It had short arms, a long, pointed tail, three-toed, hoofed feet, and mitten-like hands. Its head was flat and sloping with a wide, toothless beak, cheek pouches, and hundreds of closely-packed cheek teeth that ground up its food. It is the same animal as "Anatotitan". There are two species, and the animal has been called by several other names in the past.
"Edmontosaurus" was named from a fossil found in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, in Alberta, Canada. Many "Edmontosaurus" fossils have been found, in Alberta, and Alaska, Wyoming, Montana and New Jersey in the USA. Two mummified "Edmontosaurus" fossils were found in Wyoming.
The distribution of its fossils suggests that it preferred coasts and coastal plains. It could move on two legs and on four. Because it is known from several bone beds, "Edmontosaurus" is thought to have lived in groups. It may have been migratory.
Most of the back and tail was lined by bony tendons arranged in a lattice along the neural spines of the vertebrae. This made the back and part of the tail "ramrod" straight. The ossified tendons strengthened the vertebral column against gravitational stress. It was a large animal with a horizontal vertebral column otherwise supported mostly by the hind legs and hips.
As a hadrosaurid, "Edmontosaurus" was a large terrestrial herbivore. Its teeth were continually replaced and packed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of teeth, only a relative handful of which were in use at any time. It used its broad beak to cut loose food, perhaps by cropping, or by closing the jaws in a clamshell-like manner over twigs and branches and then stripping off the more nutritious leaves and shoots. "Edmontosaurus" and most other ornithischians probably had cheek-like structures, muscular or non-muscular. The function of the cheeks was to keep food in the mouth. The animal's feeding range would have been from ground level to about above.

Ornitholestes was a carnivorous dinosaur which lived in the Upper Jurassic period about 156145 million years ago. It was about 2 metres long (6.6 feet), half of which was its long tail. Only one specimen of it has ever been found.
It is one of a group of small, fast-running dinosaurs which are classified as early Coelurosaurs. It is known from a partial skeleton found near Medicine Bow, Wyoming, in 1900. It was described by paleontologist Henry F. Osborn in 1903.
"Ornitholestes" was a bipedal runner. Its small head suggests it ate small mammals, lizards, frogs, and hatchling dinosaurs. It could grasp prey with both hands. It is likely that all coelurosaurs had feathers.

Liverwort

The liverworts are a group of simple plants. Molecular evidence based on mitochondrial DNA suggests strongly that they are the stem group from which mosses, hornworts and all higher plants evolved.
Liverworts are usually regarded as Bryophytes, together with mosses and hornworts. Recent taxonomy places them separately in a division called the Marchantiophyta, or even the Antheroceratophyta. However, since the classification is not yet settled, we keep the old terms for convenience.
Liverworts, as the illustration shows, are small plants with flattened bodies, or with flattened stems bearing overlapping scales.
Liverworts have a gametophyte-dominant life cycle. This is a type of alternation of generations similar to that of mosses. Cells in a typical liverwort plant are haploid for most of its life cycle. Their stalked sporophytes (diploid) are very short-lived, withering away soon after releasing the spores.

<doc id="220629" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=220629" title="Seed dispersal">
Seed dispersal

Seed dispersal is the way seeds get from the parent plant to a new place. "Dispersal" means to spread or scatter. The basic idea is as follows. Plants, obviously, cannot move after they have put down roots. It follows that it is an evolutionary advantage to get their seeds away from the parent plant. If the seeds take root nearby they will compete with each other and the parent plant. Also, a species is more likely to survive when its members are widely spread. This is because local disasters still leave plants in other places.
From the first land plants in the Silurian period for 300 million years to the Lower Cretaceous, virtually all transport of spores and seeds was done by mechanical means. In fact, for most types of plants both fertilisation and dispersal was done by wind. If not wind, then water was the medium. A great change took place with the appearance of flowering plants in the Cretaceous.
The story of flowers and insects is one of the best examples of co-evolution. The gut contents, wing structures, and mouthparts of fossilized beetles and flies suggest that they acted as early pollinators. The association between beetles and angiosperms during the Lower Cretaceous period led to parallel radiations of angiosperms and insects in the Upper Cretaceous. The evolution of nectaries in Upper Cretaceous flowers signals the beginning of the mutualism between hymenopterans and angiosperms.
What is true of fertilisation is also true of dispersal. Spores, the tiny products of lower plants, are almost always dispersed by wind. So are many seeds. Some seeds, and their later development, fruits, are obviously adaptations to a world full of animals. If they are dispersed by being eaten, it is advantageous for them to be nutritious and good to eat. So spores, seeds and fruits may get dispersed mechanicallly or by animals:
An important detail for a wind-dispersed seed is that it is very light. It must be able to float easily on wind or else it will drop straight to the ground. There are "parachutes" on top of some seeds, like milkweed and dandelion seeds. Some seeds are very small and light, almost like dust. Orchid seeds and poppy seeds are like that. Poppy seeds are inside a little capsule that has little openings around the top. On a windy day, the poppy fruit capsule will sway from side to side, shaking out the tiny seeds out the windows like a salt shaker. 
Another kind of fruit that can be wind-dispersed is the maple tree fruit. The maple tree has little "schizocarps", which are two-sided winged fruits. They are also called "samaras." Their lightness and "wings" help them stay in the air until they have reached a new place with lots of soil. Elm and birch trees also have samaras.
Some fruits can fling (throw) their seeds away when they are ripe. This is a type of rapid plant movement, where the fruit is thrown from a little "machine".
Pea pods often use mechanical dispersal. When the seeds are ready, the pod dries up. When the pod dries, the inside of the pod dries faster than the outside. This makes the pod twist inside, suddenly splitting open violently, rolling into a little spiral. When this roll happens, it makes the seeds fly out of the pod in all directions.
"Impatiens" called "touch-me-nots" or "jewel weeds" is a large genus of flowering plants. When the seeds are ripe and ready, the dried fruit becomes a trigger. When an animal or human touches the plant, it bursts open and sprays the seeds everywhere. If the ground is wet, the seeds can germinate right where they land; they can also stick to the creature that made the capsule burst open. This can help them be carried off to a new place.
Violets and gorses use mechanical dispersal, too. When the seeds are ready, it opens with a loud "POP!" sound. Another fruit called the squirting cucumber uses mechanical dispersal, too. There are hundreds of other fruits that use mechanical dispersal.
These plants usually grow near the water. Once the seed falls into the water, it may be carried for a long distance before it finds a place to grow.
A good example is the water lily. Water lilies' beautiful flowers create a fruit that floats in the water for some time and then sinks to the bottom to take root on the floor of a pond. The seeds of the water lily can be dispersed and germinated in the water.
The palm tree, which grows near the water, also disperses its seeds by water. Powerful ocean currents that connect continents move the palm tree's seeds, called coconuts, to their new home.
The mangrove tree lives right in the water. Their seeds fall from the tree and grow roots as soon as they touch soil. If there is a lot of water, they can be carried far away.
Most nuts, like acorns, walnuts, and pecans are dispersed by "both" water and animals. The main way that they are dispersed by water is during flood times, or if their plants grow near a river or stream. Many nut trees grow near places that flood quite often. Though water is important for nut trees, it's not as important as it is for other plants, because many trees have roots that can grow a long way from the tree to find good soil and water.
There are several ways seeds get dispersed by animals. One example are the burrs that stick to your socks and pants when you walk through grassy fields. The parent plant makes the spiky little burrs from the flower. These burrs are either thrown off the plant and onto the ground, or they stay on the plant until a passing animal (or person) gets the burr in its fur, feathers, or socks. Then the burr is carried to a new place, where animals usually try to get it off themselves. Animals , scratch, or peck at the burrs to get them off. The burr is then dropped on the ground, away from the parent plant. Many grass seeds have surfaces which catch onto passing creatures. For instance spear grass has spiky tips that can get stuck in passing animals or blown by a strong wind to a new place.
Another way for animals to help in seed dispersal is for the animals to actually plant the seeds themselves. Animals like mice, squirrels, and jay birds collect fruits and nuts during the spring and summer, and they store them for the coming winter. Many times, they save up these fruits and nuts by burying them in the ground - often more than they need. When they come to take their fruits and nuts away, they leave a few buried. The ones that are left buried become plants.
Seeds are often dispersed in droppings (poo). Animals swallow fruit (including seeds): they digest the soft fruit, but the seeds come out in their droppings. In some rainforests, almost 90% of tree species are dispersed by animals. Animals like bats for instance, the short-tailed fruit bat in South America can scatter up to 60,000 seeds in one night.

Route availability

Route Availability (RA) is the system by which the permanent way and supporting works (bridges, embankments, etc.) of the National Rail network of Great Britain are graded. All routes are given an RA number between 1 and 10.
Rolling stock is also given an RA (again between 1 and 10) and the RA of a train is the highest RA of any of the supporting elements. The RA is mainly about the axle load of the vehicle, although axle spacing is also taken into thought. In practice it is the locomotive which decides where trains may operate, although many high capacity four axle wagons have high RAs when fully loaded. (When considering the operation of trains the loading gauge must also be considered.)

Butterfly gardening is a growing school of gardening, that is aimed at creating an environment that attracts butterflies, as well as some moths. Butterfly gardening is often done to invite those butterflies and moths to lay eggs as well. In addition to the planting of flowers that feed butterflies, other methods of attracting them are building "butterfly houses", with sand for puddling, water to drink, and food items, like rotten fruit.

Hornwort

Hornworts are a group of bryophytes, or non-vascular plants. The name refers to the elongated horn-like structure, which is the sporophyte. The flattened, green plant body of a hornwort is the gametophyte plant.
Like all bryophytes, the hornworts have alternation of generations in which the green plant body is a haploid gametophyte, and the sporophyte is the diploid fruiting body.
Hornworts may be found world-wide, growing where it is damp or humid. Some species grow in large numbers as tiny weeds in the soil of gardens and cultivated fields. Large tropical species of "Dendroceros" may be found growing on tree bark.
The taxonomy of bryophytes is being debated. Some think the hornworts should be placed in a separate division, the Anthocerotophyta.

Airbus A310

The Airbus A310 is a jet airliner made by Airbus. It was announced in July 1978 and it was the second aircraft to be made by Airbus. The A310 is a shorter version of the Airbus A300, which was Airbus' first plane.
When the Airbus A300 was being designed, Airbus studied many different sizes of plane. The Airbus A300B was chosen, and it was one of the smaller designs. When the A300B prototypes were made, many airlines asked for a plane which could hold more passengers. Airbus then changed to the A300B2 version, which was the first type to be made. Airbus noticed that many airlines also wanted smaller planes. Some airlines did not have enough passengers to use the A300. 
Airbus wanted to keep the cost of designing a smaller A300 as low as possible. Airbus decided that the plane would hold 220 passengers, which was what many airlines wanted. 
Another problem was the rate of inflation. In the UK during 1979–1980, it was 35%. This would mean that the designing costs would be very high, and so would the price of the plane. 
From late 1977, BAe began designing the wing for the A310 at Hatfield. 
At the April 1978 Hanover Air Show, Airbus brought a model A310. Its wing area was , was a bit larger than what Airbus designed. If two classes were used in the plane, 195 passengers could travel in the aircraft. If the plane is all-economy, 245 passengers could fit inside. 
On 15 March, Swissair bought the A310. It said that it would buy 10 and have 10 options, to replace its McDonnell Douglas DC-9 series. Lufthansa bought ten planes for $240 million. Air France and Iberia soon did the same. On 1 April 1979 Lufthansa increased its order to 25 orders and 25 options. Two days later, KLM bought 10 planes and had 10 options, which cost ₤238 million. Other airlines which bought the A310 during 1979 included Martinair, Sabena and Air Afrique.
At first, Airbus planned two versions of the A310: the A310-100 and the A310-200. The A310-100 could fly for with 200 passengers, and the -200 could carry the same number of passengers for longer.
Airlines kept buying the A310, and the A310-200 flew for the first time on 3 April 1982. Orders and options had been made for 181 aircraft, which was a much better start than the A300. Airbus realised that the −200 aircraft was much more popular than the -100 aircraft. In 1979, Airbus decided to stop making the A310-100.
No airlines bought the A310 during the late 1990s because Airbus had made the Airbus A330. Airbus stopped making the A300 and the A310 in July 2007. The freighter version of the A310 was replaced by the A330-200F.
The A310 was replaced by the A330-200. Between 1983 and 1998, 255 A310s were made. 
The A300 and A310 helped Airbus compete with Boeing.
The A310 was a changed version of the A300; the aircraft was first called the A300B10. The main differences between the A300 and the A310 are:
The aircraft has a glass cockpit. The A300-600 has the same flight deck as the A310. The flight deck can hold up to two more seats.
Two versions of the A310 were made: the −200 and the −300. The first version which was designed was the −200.
The militaries of these countries use the A310.
When Airbus stopped making A310s, 255 had been ordered and delivered.
The A310 has had ten hull-loss accidents. 825 people have died in these accidents. A hull-loss accident is when a plane is damaged so much that it cannot be repaired, or if the plane is completely destroyed.
The A310 has also had ten hijackings. Five people have died in these.

The Secret of NIMH 2: Timmy to the Rescue

The Secret of NIMH 2: Timmy to the Rescue is a 1998 American direct-to-video animated movie. It is the sequel to "The Secret of NIMH" produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Animation. It tells the story of a mouse named Timothy Brisby, the youngest son of Jonathan and Mrs. Brisby, who goes to Thorn Valley wanting to become a hero like his father. 
The movie was made without the support of Don Bluth, the animator who created the original movie. 
The movie begins with a prophecy from the first movie, telling how one of Jonathan's and Mrs. Brisby's sons would save Thorn Valley from the "secret of NIMH." Timothy is chosen to go but his older brother Martin believes he should have been chosen. Martin decides to prove his quality, and goes off to find his own adventure. 
One day he comes across a female mouse named Jenny, whose parents were two of the lost six mice who tried to escape NIMH but were thought to have died. 
The Thorn Valley council decides it would be too dangerous to save the six mice, so Jenny and Timmy go alone. They take a hot air balloon, but it is attacked by a hawk and it crashes in the forest.
Seeking help, they visit the Great Owl. They learn that a caterpillar named Cecil has teamed up with Jeremy, the crow from the first movie, to trick people into paying them money. Jeremy and Cecil take the two mice to NIMH where they find that two other mice, Justin and Brutus. They also learn that Dr. Valentine, the head scientist, has made Martin crazy. He planned to use the lab rats and a flock of ravens to take over Thorn Valley. 
He asks Timmy to join him, but he refuses and is locked in a cage as Martin drags Jenny away. Timmy later frees Jenny. Together, they knock out Martin and Timmy tricks Martin's army of ravens and rats to fly in the wrong direction. Timmy and Jenny then leave to find the others only to be attacked by a band of bad cats and rats. 
The building they are in catches fire during the fight. The survivors (Timmy, Jenny, and her parents) flee. Timmy goes back to save Martin. Before he leaves, Jenny tells him she loves him and he tells her the same. Timmy and Martin are able to escape through the lab's skylight, with some help from Jeremy. Jeremy takes the survivors to safety. The mice return to Thorn Valley, Martin returns to normal and Timmy is now a hero. A likeness of him is added to the statue of Jonathan and the people of Thorn Valley cheer.

European honey bee

The European honey bee or western honey bee ("Apis mellifera") is the main species of honey bee. The genus "Apis" is Latin for "bee", and mellifera comes from Greek melli- meaning "honey" and ferre "to bear". So, the scientific name means "honey-bearing bee". In 1758 Carolus Linnaeus named the bees as "Apis mellifera". However, he later found out that bees do not bear honey, but they actually bear nectar. Because of this, he tried to change it to "Apis mellifica" ("honey-making bee") later.
Workers do a waggle dance in the beehive to tell the others where they have found nectar; Karl von Frisch discovered this.

<doc id="220742" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=220742" title="Blue jay">
Blue jay

The blue jay ("Cyanocitta cristata") is a passerine bird native to North America. It is adaptable, aggressive and omnivorous.
The blue jay measures 22–30 cm (9–12 inches) from bill to tail and weighs 70–100 grams (2.47–3.53 oz), with a wingspan of 34–43 cm (13–17 inches). There is a crown of feathers on the top of the head, which may be raised or lowered according to the bird's mood. When excited or aggressive, the crest may be fully raised. When scared, the crest comes outwards, brushlike. When the bird is feeding among other jays or resting, the crest is flattened to the head.
Its plumage is lavender-blue to mid-blue in the crest, back, wings, and tail, and its face is white. The underside is off-white and the neck has a thin stripe with black which extends to the sides of the head. The main wing and tail feathers are deep with black, sky-blue and white. The bill, legs, and eyes are all black. Males and females look nearly the same except that males are a little bit larger.
Blue jays have strong black bills used for cracking open nuts, and acorns and for eating corn, grains and seeds, although they also eat insects such as beetles, grasshoppers, and caterpillars.
Blue jays can make many different sounds, and single sounds may vary a bit. Blue jays can learn to mimic human speech. Blue jays can also copy the callings of local hawks so well that it is sometimes difficult to tell which it is. Their voice is normal of most jays in being varied, but the most commonly thought sound is the "alarm call", which is a loud, almost gull-like scream. There is also a high-pitched jayer-jayer call that increases in speed as the bird becomes more excited.This very call can be easily confused with the chick-a-dee's song because of the slow starting chick-ah-dee-ee. Blue Jays will use these calls to band together to mob predators such as hawks and drive them away from the jays' nests.
The blue jay is a slow flier ( 32–40 km/h (20-25 mi/h) when unprovoked) and an easy prey for hawks and owls, when it flies in open lands. It flies with its body and tail held level, with slow wing beats. It is sometimes assertive toward other birds and may chase birds from bird feeders or other food sources, although this happens much less often than it is blamed for. This can be good to other species as well, as it may chase predatory birds, such as hawks and owls which sometimes feed on jays, and will scream if it sees a predator within its territory. It has also been known to sound an "alarm call" when hawks or other dangers are near, and smaller birds often know this call and hide themselves away accordingly. It may also be aggressive towards humans who come close to its nest, and if an owl roosts near the nest during the daytime the blue jay mobs it until it takes a new roost.
Its food is found both on the ground and in trees and has almost all known types of plant and animal sources, like acorns and beech mast, weed seeds, grain, fruits and other berries, peanuts, bread, meat, small invertebrates of many types, scraps in town parks, bird-table food and rarely eggs and nestlings. Blue jays will sometimes catch food, though to what extent is different among individuals.
The mating season starts in mid-March and reaches into July. Any nice tree or large shrub may be used for nesting, though an evergreen is . The nest is normally made at a height of 3 to 10 meters. This cup-shaped nest is made of twigs, small roots, bark strips, moss, other plant material, cloth, paper, and feathers, sometimes with mud added to the cup.
Blue jays mostly form monogamous pair bonds for life. Both sexes make the nest and take care of the young, though only the female broods them. The male feeds the female while she is brooding the eggs. There are normally 4–5 eggs laid and incubated over 16–18 days. The young leave the nest normally between 17–21 days after hatching.
Jays are some of the more smart birds. They will wait and watch for a person to put food down and as soon as the person walks away they will come down from their hiding place and take it. Along with crows, jays will also watch a person planting seed crops and afterwards dig up and eat the seeds.

Bart the Genius

"Bart the Genius" is the second episode of The Simpsons' first season, which first started on the Fox network on January 14, 1990. It was the first episode written by Jon Vitti. It was also the first ever episode to use the signature title sequence, as well as the first normal episode. The episode has Bart Simpson's experiences of life as a smarty-pants after he cheats on an intelligence test. It is the first episode that uses Bart's catchphrase "Eat my shorts." As the second episode was made, right after the bad animation of "Some Enchanted Evening," the future of the series relied on how the animation turned out on this episode. The animation proved to be more acceptable and production continued.
The episode starts with the Simpson family playing Scrabble. Bart plays the word "kwyjibo", which is not a real word.

Terrier

A terrier is a dog of any one of many breeds of terrier types. They are named from the Latin word "terra" meaning earth. It refers to their love of digging after their prey (small burrowing mammals). Terriers are typically small, very active and fearless dogs. Terrier breeds vary greatly in size from just to over . They are usually categorized by size or function. There are five different groups with each group having several different breeds. Terriers do not usually tolerate other dogs well. They are descended from dogs bred to hunt and kill rodents. Terriers usually have 'wiry' (stiff hairs like wire) coats that need special care. Examples of terriers include Irish Terrier and the Cairn Terrier.

Viswanathan Anand

Viswanathan Anand, known as "Vishy", (born 11 December 1969) is a former World Chess Champion. He comes from India. Vishy is the oldest player in modern times to become classical World Champion for the first time: he was 37 when he won in 2007.
When the world championship was split, Anand played in both versions. In the classical chess versions, sometimes called the "PCA cycle", Anand won matches against Oleg Romanishin and Michael Adams without a loss, then avenged his FIDE loss by defeating Gata Kamsky in the Candidates final. In 1995, he played the PCA World Chess Championship 1995 against Kasparov in New York City's World Trade Center. After an opening run of eight draws (a record for the opening of a world championship match), Anand won game nine with a powerful exchange sacrifice, but then lost four of the next five. He lost the match 10½–7½.
Anand held the FIDE World Chess Championship from 2000 to 2002 when the world title was split. This was a knock-out event of a different type from the classical matches. He became the undisputed World Champion in 2007 and defended his title against Vladimir Kramnik in 2008. With this win, he became the first player in chess history to have won the World Championship in three different formats: knockout, tournament, and match. 
Anand retained the world title by beating Veselin Topalov 6½–5½ in May 2010. He kept the title again by defeating Boris Gelfand in 2012. This match was won in a four-game rapidplay tiebreaker, after the main match was tied at 6–6.
Anand is one of a small group of players to break the 2800 mark on the FIDE rating list, and in April 2007 at the age of 37, he became world number one for the first time. He was at the top of the world rankings five out of six times, from April 2007 to July 2008, holding the number one ranking for a total of 15 months. In October 2008, he dropped out of the world top three ranking for the first time since July 1996. 
In 2007 he was awarded India's second highest civilian award, the Padma Vibhushan. He is also the first recipient of Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award in 1991–92, India's highest sporting honour. Though retaining his Indian citizenship, Vishy has been living in Spain for the past decade.
Anand lost the title to Magnus Carlsen in 2013, and also lost the return match in 2014 by 4½ to 6½.

Continental Airlines

Continental Airlines was an American airline based and headquartered in downtown Houston, Texas. It was founded in 1937. It was the fourth-largest airline in the US based on revenue passenger miles. Since 1998, Continental's marketing slogan had been "Work Hard, Fly Right". Continental Airlines announced on Monday, May 3, 2010, that they were merging with United Airlines. The merger was approved in September 2010, and the parent company changed its name to United Continental Holdings when United completed its acquisition of Continental. The combined airline takes the United Airlines name but uses Continental's globe and livery. There has been negative reaction to the new livery, many of whom were in favor of keeping the iconic "tulip" logo, designed by Saul Bass in 1973.
Continental operated flights to destinations throughout the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific regions. Together with its subsidiaries it had more than 2,423 daily departures, serving 130 domestic and 132 international destinations and had 42,210 employees (as of December 2009). Principal operations were from its three hubs at Newark Liberty International Airport, George Bush Intercontinental Airport, and Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. Continental Micronesia, owned by Continental, operated routes around Micronesia from its hub at Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport in Guam, and connected the Micronesian region with destinations in East Asia, Southeast Asia, Honolulu and Cairns, Australia.

Chasmosaurus lived 65 to 100 million years ago and was 5 to 6 metres long with a weight of 3.6 tonnes -- about as much as 2 cars.
They lived in western North America from Alaska to Mexico.

Mississippian

The Mississippian is the first geological epoch in the Carboniferous. It began about 359 million years ago (mya), and ended 323 mya.
The names Mississippian and Pennsylvanian are used in North America, because they suit the strata there. Geologists from elsewhere mostly use simply 'Carboniferous', or they use the official terms for stages, as defined by the International Commission for Stratigraphy. 
During the Mississippian the sea level was high, and much of North America was invaded by a shallow sea. The strata consist mostly of a sequence of marine limestones.

<doc id="220839" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=220839" title="Pennsylvanian">
Pennsylvanian

The Pennsylvanian is the Upper Carboniferous epoch in the strata of North America. It comes after (above) the Mississippian, and before the Permian. The Pennsylvanian started about 323 million years ago (mya), and ended about 299 mya.
The "coal measures", which give the Carboniferous its name, are the remains of peat formed by dense tropical wetland forests. They were formed in the Pennsylvanian, from about 315–300 million years years ago.
These forests were on the equator, and the wetlands, which are always low-lying, stretched from North America in the west, through what is now Europe to China in the east, because these continents were all together at the time (Laurussia). The river plain which was the heart of the wetland stretched 5000km from eastern Canada to the Ukraine, and was 700km wide. This would make the Pennsylvanian basin larger than any wetlands on Earth today.
The characteristic vertebrates of the coal measures were amphibia, and the plants were mostly giant clubmosses such as "Lepidodendron".
The rainforest system collapsed about halfway through the Pennsylvanian, and was replaced by a cooler, drier climate. The wetland forests ended when the land level was raised by the pressure of the Gondwana continent against Laurussia, causing the zone of contact to be raised. The end of the Coal Measures marks the end of the Carboniferous period. China was too far away to be affected, and there the wetland forests continued for another 50 million years, into the early Permian.
As the climate became drier, egg-laying amniotes (Synapsids and Sauropsids) became more common than amphibia. These are the lines that would lead to reptiles and mammals. These egg-laying land vertebrates probably split from the early amniotes in the Mississippian.

<doc id="220852" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=220852" title="Viceroy (butterfly)">
Viceroy (butterfly)

The Viceroy ("Limenitis archippus") is a species of butterfly. It belongs in the family Nymphalidae. It is found in North America.
The wings are orange. They have black veins and black wing edges. There is a black band across the hind wing (bottom wing). This band can sometimes be faint or missing if the butterfly lives in the southwestern United States. In Florida, the Viceroy is dark reddish brown instead of orange. The wingspan ranges from 6.6 to 7.6 cm (2.6 to 3 in).
The orange Viceroys mimic the Monarch ("Danaus plexippus"). The reddish brown Viceroys mimic the Queen ("Danaus gilippus") and the Soldier ("Danaus eresimus"). 
The caterpillar feeds on trees in the willow family Salicaceae, including willows ("Salix"), and poplars and cottonwoods ("Populus"). The caterpillars store the salicylic acid in their bodies, which makes them bitter, and upsets predators' stomachs. As further protection, the caterpillars, as well as their chrysalis stage, resemble bird droppings. 
The Viceroy ("Limenitis archippus") is a North American butterfly with a range from the Northwest Territories along the eastern edges of the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada mountains, southwards into central Mexico.
Its wings have an orange and black pattern, and over most of its range it is a Müllerian mimic with the Monarch butterfly ("Danaus plexippus"). What this means is that they are both bitter tasting, and they both use the same pattern of colours where they live in the same territory. Müllerian mimicry is a shared warning advertisement, in this case of foul taste.
Adults fly in the late morning and early afternoon.
The Viceroy can be found from June to July in northern Canada. It can be found from May to October in southern Canada and the northern United States. It is found all year in southern Florida. In the southwestern United States, it is seen from April to November.
This butterfly is found in a wide range of wet, open places such as water edges, wet meadows, and freshwater marshes.
The female lays her eggs singly. They are laid at the tip of the host plant leaf (the host plant is the plant that the caterpillar feeds on). The egg is pale green or pale yellow. It turns gray later. The caterpillar feeds at night. It mimics a bird dropping. It is white, brown, black, and olive green. There are two greenish bumps on the thorax. There are also two spines near the head. The chrysalis also mimics a bird dropping. It is white, brown, and black. There is a large brownish bump on the abdomen. The caterpillar hibernates in a leaf shelter. It lays one set of eggs in northern Canada, and 2-3 more groups in southern Canada and the United States.

Anthozoa are a class in the phylum Cnidaria. It includes the sea anemones and the corals. It is a monophyletic clade, one of two in the Cnidaria. The other is the Medusozoa.
The class does not have a medusa larval stage in its development, unlike the rest of the phylum. Like all Cnidaria, their food-catching and defense are done by nematocysts, which are extremely effective stinging cells. Over 6,100 species have been described.
There are three subclasses:

<doc id="220918" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=220918" title="Cnida">
Cnida

The cnida is the basic term for the stinging apparatus of the phylum Cnidaria. The whole life-style of the phylum is based on this device, which enables the animals to catch their prey. The cnida appears in several forms: the most usual is the nematocyst. 
Cnidae are organelle-like capsules with eversible tubules (they shoot the tubule outwards). They are the diagnostic feature of the phylum. All cnidarians possess cnidae; no loss of the feature is known.
There are three main types of cnidae: nematocysts, ptychocysts, and spirocysts, with many variations. Depending on the species, one or more types may be on the organism.
The cell which produces the cnida is variously called a "cnidocyte", "cnidoblast", or "nematocyte". It is highly specialised for just one function. Each nematocyte cell contains an organelle with a hollow, coiled, thread-like structure. The outside of the cell has a hair-like trigger. When the trigger is touched, the shaft of the cnidocyst fires like a harpoon. It penetrates the prey, and the hollow thread comes with it. This takes no more than a few microseconds. After penetration, the toxic content of the nematocyst is injected into the target. The rapid activity of the injected neurotoxins paralyzes the mobile prey, thus allowing the sessile cnidarian to devour it.
Certain types of sea slugs, such as the nudibranch aeolids, store nematocysts from digested jellyfish at the tips of their cerata (body projections). It is quite common for predators to store useful plastids from their victims.

Brunswick, New York

Brunswick is a town in Rensselaer County, New York, United States that was first settled in the early 1700s. During its history, it had been part of Albany County, Rensselaerswyck, and Troy, before its in 1807. It is bordered on the west by the city of Troy; on the north by Schaghticoke and Pittstown; on the east by Grafton; and on the south by Poestenkill and North Greenbush. The number of people living there was 11,664 at the 2000 . The story of the town's name is fought: some say it comes from the source of its first people who lived in Germany, Brunswick-Lüneburg, while others say that it honors the "Duke of Brunswick (George I).
The town was in the past agricultural, but began experiencing suburban sprawl in the later decades of the 20th century, which continues today. Historically, most of the developments have happened around the town's two major crowded roads: New York Route 7 and New York Route 2, known locally as Hoosick Road and Brunswick Road. Brunswick became a popular place to settle in upon the completion of the local highway system in the Capital District, mostly the fix of Route 7 into a four-lane highway in the 1980s.
The town has two listings on the National Register of Historic Places, both schoolhouses: Garfield School and the Little Red Schoolhouse. And, it is home to a well-known cemetery, Forest Park Cemetery, right now under the power of the town. It is known by urban legend as being one of the most haunted cemeteries in the United States. A very small part of the historic Oakwood Cemetery, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, and burial place of Samuel Wilson, a possible namesake of Uncle Sam, remains within the northwestern part of the town.

Ferdinand Marcos

Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos (September 11, 1917 – September 28, 1989) was a Filipino politician and lawyer who served as President (1965-1986) and Prime Minister (1978-1981) of the Republic of the Philippines. He is a polarizing historical figure in both Philippines and the world. Marcos established an authoritarian regime that came under criticism for corruption and for its suppression of democratic processes and dictatorial nature. On the other hand, he achieved accomplishments most notably in infrastructure. 
Ferdinand Edralin Marcos was born on September 11, 1917, in Sarrat, Ilocos Norte, Philippines. His parents Mariano Marcos and Josefa Edralin, were both teachers from important families. He studied law at the University of the Philippines and later on top the bar examinations for lawyers., during which he was accused of assassinating his father's political rival. He represented himself as his own lawyer and he was later acquitted by the Supreme Court. 
During World War II, Marcos claimed that he had been the leader of "Ang Maharlika", guerrilla force in northern Luzon. After the war, he served as Ilocos Norte Representative (1949-1959) and as Senator of the Philippines (1958-1965). He was also Senate President (1963-1965) and then went on to become the President of the Philippines. As a president, he helped improve the infrastructure of the Philippines. He was also good at international diplomacy. He was probably the best and most intelligent and smartest president of the Philippines and many preferred his autocratic rule with iron fist. However, in other side, he may be the one of the most corrupt leaders such as Suharto or Kim Il-Sung or Kim Jong Il due to atrocities. A few years later, national problems like the insurgency by the communist movement and rebellion arose during his presidency: He declared Martial Law in September 1972 to institute peace and order and discipline. His style of leadership soon became dictatorial. Government greed, government bullying, despotism, nepotism, and violation of human rights abuses were abundant. The nation's masses who went against the government were sent to prison, tortured, raped or killed. People could not express themselves freely unless it was in favor of the Marcos family.
In 1983, he was accused in the assassination of his main rival and challenger, politician Benigno Aquino, Jr. but until today the killer remain unknown. The death of Benigno Aquino, Jr. caused many events, like a wrongful president vote. People became angry after and kicked him out with the help of the US during the peaceful EDSA revolution in February 1986. 
He and his wife Imelda Marcos were accused to have stolen billions of dollars of government funds and had it secretly sent to bank accounts in the United States, Switzerland, and other countries, as well as into fake companies under his name. However, until today Imelda Marcos was never sent to prison nor found guilty of stealing billions of dollars of government money and she remains free and was even elected in congress representing her home province of Leyte. Her son Ferdinand Marcos was back into politics and became a senator of the Philippines while her daughter Imee Marcos is currently the governor of Ilocos Norte.
During the people Power EDSA revolution he was flown to [Hawaii]] by a US plane instead of going to his hometown Paoay, Ilocos Norte. President Marcos died in Hawaii of heart, kidney and lung diseases. He was brought back to the Philippines and his remains still lie in a refrigerated crypt in Batac, Ilocos Norte until today because the current administration refuses to grant the former president a burial at the Libingan ng mga Bayani where other former presidents of the Philippines who died are buried.

Red-tailed hawk

The red-tailed hawk ("Buteo jamaicensis") is sometimes called a chickenhawk, even though it does not normally eat chickens. It is a bird of prey. It breeds throughout most of North America, from western Alaska and northern Canada and as far south as Panama and the West Indies. It weighs from to and its wingspan goes from to .
The red-tailed hawk is a carnivore and eats shrews and mice. They have keen eyesight to see even the smallest mouse scamper across a field. It can swoop down at least 80mph per hour. It will pick up its prey, dig its talons into its body and kill it and eat. It can swoop down so fast that it can pick up its prey in less than 5 seconds.
Because they are so common and easily trained, most hawks got for falconry in the United States are red-tails. Falconers may take only 'passage hawks' (which have left the nest, are on their own, but are less than a year old). This is so not to affect the breeding population. Adults, which may be breeding or rearing chicks, may not be taken for falconry purposes and it is illegal to do so. 
Passage red-tailed hawks are also preferred by falconers because these younger birds have not yet developed adult behaviors, which would make training much more difficult.

Hurricane Emily (2005)

Hurricane Emily was a very strong July hurricane in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. In fact, Emily is the only known category 5 hurricane in the month of July. Emily also broke the record for the strongest hurricane, just days after Hurricane Dennis had done so. Hurricane Emily was also one of four category 5 hurricane in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. Hurricane Emily affected many countries, this includes: the countries in the Windward Islands, Jamaica, Honduras, Cayman Islands, Mexico (twice), and Texas a state in the United States. The hurricane caused about $988 million in damage and killed 15 people. Even though all of this happened, the name "Emily" was not retired, so it was used again in 2011.
On July 10, Tropical Depression Six started. Late the next day the depression became a tropical storm, it got the name "Emily", making it "Tropical Storm Emily". The storm headed west toward the Windward Islands. Tropical Storm Emily slowly and then quickly got stronger. Emily became a hurricane, shortly before striking Grenada on July 14 with winds at 90 mph. After Emily left the island, it got stronger, which caused it to became a category 2, and a category 3 not long later. Over the next day, Hurricane Emily got stronger and weaker. On July 16, Hurricane Emily reached its highest strength, becoming a category 5 for a short moment and getting winds at 160 mph. 
After this, Emily weakened just a little, keeping it at a strong category 4. Hurricane Emily made landfall in Cozumel and the Yucatan Peninsula on July 18, while still a category 4. The hurricane weakened a lot over the Yucatan Peninsula, going back into the Gulf of Mexico while barely a category 1. It slowly got stronger as it crossed the Gulf of Mexico. The hurricane did not really get any stronger until it was about half way to its next landfall. Hurricane Emily made its final landfall in Tamaulipas, Mexico as a category 3, on July 20. The hurricane died the next day over Mexico. 
Hurricane Emily caused a lot of damage, nearly $1 billion worth, and about 15 people got killed. Most of this happened in Mexico, because it got struck twice by Emily. Damage in Mexico was near $632 million. While just over $178 million in damage happened in Texas. 
Even though all of this happened, the name Emily did not get retired in the spring of 2006. So, the name Emily was used again in 2011. Emily is the fourth category 5 hurricane not to get its name retired.

Sauropelta

Sauropelta was an armoured dinosaur from the Lower Cretaceous. It looked a lot like its more advanced relative "Ankylosaurus", but didn't have the bony nodes at the end of its tail. 
Anatomically, "Sauropelta" is one of the best-understood nodosaurids, with fossilized remains recovered in the U.S. states of Wyoming, Montana, and possibly Utah. It is also the earliest known genus of nodosaurid; most of its remains date to about 115 to 110 million years ago.
It was a medium-sized nodosaurid, measuring about 5 meters (16.5 ft) long. "Sauropelta" had a distinctively long tail which made up about half of its body length. Although its body was smaller than a modern black rhinoceros, "Sauropelta" was about the same mass, weighing in at about 1,500 kilograms (3,300 lb). The extra weight was largely due to its extensive armour, including the large spines projecting from its neck.
As in other ankylosaurs, thick triangular scutes projected above and behind the eyes, as well as below and behind the eyes. More typically for nodosaurids, leaf-shaped teeth lined both upper and lower jaws, used for cutting plant material. The front end of the skull is unknown, but there would have been a keratinous beak.

Ouranosaurus was a sail-backed, plant-eating, iguanodontid dinosaur from the Lower Cretaceous period. It was about 24 feet (7 m) long and may have weighed about 4 tons.
Two almost complete "Ouranosaurus" fossils were found in the southern Sahara Desert, in northeast Niger, in 1966. "Spinosaurus", a large, sail-backed meat-eater, was one of its contemporaries in the hot, Cretaceous environment of north Africa. "Ouranosaurus" was named by the French paleontologist Phillippe Taquet in 1976.

Morning Musume

In late 1997, in Japan,a male singer-songwriter called Tsunku, held a contest to find a girl to be the lead singer of the band Sharam Q, which he was the frontman of. A lot of young girls came to the contest, and some of them became finalists. There is where Tsunku came up with the idea of making a girl group. This new group was called Morning Musume (Morning Daughters). The group was formed by Kaori Iida, Yuko Nakazawa, Asuka Fukuda, Aya Ishiguro and Natsumi Abe. They became known as the "First Generation" of the group. There have now been twelve of these "Generations". Most of these "Generations" have a few members. But the Third, Seventh and Twelfth Generations only had one member each.
From the start, the songs performed by these girls sold well. They became very famous in Japan (their fame later reached other countries too, thanks to their fans on the World Wide Web), and Tsunku formed other small groups inspired by Morning Musume. He created Hello!Project to hold them all.
Over time, when the girls become older and mature, they usually graduate from the group (but they can be kicked out for not behaving in the way that idols are supposed to behave). After that, they usually become soloists or models. New girls apply for a spot in the group whenever auditions are held. Thousands of girls apply, but very few make it in.
Morning Musume is still a top selling female group. In fact, its sales make it one of the best-selling girl groups in the World today, ranking around 9th - 11th place among girl groups worldwide in recent years, although much of this is probably due to the sheer amount of material released. At present it is known as "Morning Musume '14", which is pronounced as "Morning Musume One Four". It has new girls and makes singles every few months, plus studio albums about once a year. These singles and studio albums often come in "limited" versions with different cover photos and photo cards or posters included. In addition, there are also many live DVD and Blu-Ray releases, as well as photobooks and DVDs featuring certain members wearing clothes that show off how attractive they are. All the girls from the group appear frequently on TV and Radio. Their TV appearances are in the morning, especially for young people. They also make music videos and perform a lot of concerts in Japan, as well as sometimes performing concerts in other countries. Their music videos also come in different versions most of the time.

Scyphozoa

The Scyphozoa is a class of the phylum Cnidaria, sometimes referred to as the "true jellyfish". There are 200 species. The name Scyphozoa comes from a Greek word which refers to the cup shape of the jellyfish.
The medusa form is the dominant life form, as opposed to the polyp. They eat plankton, small crustaceans and fish larvae, which they capture using stinging cells called nematocysts. The nematocysts are attached to the tentacles that hang down from the edge of the umbrella dome. Scyphozoans have an internal jelly-like material. They have no hard parts, no head, and no specialized organs for respiration or excretion. 
Unlike other types of jellyfish, scyphozoans lack a "velum", a circular membrane which propels other jellyfish through the water. Scyphozoans move through the water by contracting and relaxing the muscles of their umbrella.

Hydrozoa

The Hydrozoa are a class of the phylum Cnidaria. They are small predatory animals which mostly live in the sea. Their basic life form is the polyp. Some species live singly, others live in colonies. Their classification and evolutionary relationships are still under discussion. The hydroids may be best understood by taking some examples.
The most widely-known freshwater hydrozoan is "Hydra", which is found in slow-moving waters.
It is sessile, with a pedal disc which attaches it to substrate. Like all cnidarians, "Hydra" uses nematocysts, stinging cells which disable its prey. Hydra eat small crustaceans (such as brine shrimp), insect larvae, and annelid worms. It may reproduce sexually, or by asexual reproduction (budding).
The Portuguese Man o' War, "Physalia physalis", is a large colonial marine jellyfish. It is composed of many tiny individual zooids, which are specialised polyps and medusae. The colony has an air bladder, and floats on the surface. It delivers a massive sting to its prey. Humans, if stung, may require medical attention. It is often accompanied by fish which are immune to the stings. This type of hydrozoan is called a siphonophore.
The chondrophores are another type of pelagic colonial hydrozoan. They are also carnivores, but their sting is not so harmful to humans.
These have a muscular "velum" on the ventral surface, which allows them to move about. Beginning life as a tiny polyp, attached to vegetation, they feed and reproduce sexually in the spring and summer. If the habitat has only one sex, they reproduce by budding. They overwinter as resting bodies.
Nowadays the Hydrozoa is split into two subclasses:

The Cubozoa, the box jellies, contain some of the most dangerous jellyfish in the phylum Cnidaria. They make up a small class of Cnidarians, with only 19 species. It is their powerful venom which makes them noteworthy.
All cubozoans have four 'legs' (pedalia) hanging from the corners, from which hang tentacles. They have a rudimentary neural network. The cubozoans can move through the water to actively hunt prey, and have a degree of sight as they have up to 24 eyes. Cubozoans have two main eyes on each of the four pedalia, each with a lens, retina and cornea; and some species also have eye-spots as well. 
The box jellies are found in tropical oceanic waters round the world. Their venom is delivered by stinging nematocysts, which cluster on tentacles, each with half a million stinging cells. The largest species, "Chironex fleckeri", has caused many human deaths. The pain of an attack is agonising, and heart failure is a danger. The attack can be treated: first with vinegar, then remove stingers, then apply anti-venom.

Milkweed butterfly

The Danainae is a subfamily of butterflies. It belongs in the family Nymphalidae. There are over 200 species. They are commonly known as Milkweed butterflies or danaids.
These butterflies are common in tropical places all over the world. One of the most famous butterflies, the Monarch ("Danaus plexippus"), belongs in this subfamily. The larvae and the butterflies get poisonous glycosides from their larval host plant, the milkweed, so they become distasteful to predators. These milkweed butterflies (Monarch, Queen, Soldier) eat only milkweeds ("Asclepias") as larvae. This highly effective defence strategy shields them against almost all predators. Birds soon learn to avoid these species after attempting to eat them.
Males in this subfamily have anal hairs. This body part at the end of the abdomen can be pulled back inside the body. They also have spots on the bottom wings that release scents to attract females. The male raises his abdomen and puts his hair pencils into the androconia. After the hairs have the chemical on them, the male will use them during courtship.

The Staurozoa are a Class in the phylum Cnidaria. It includes the stalked jellyfish. It was an order within the Class Scyphozoa, but recent genetic work has shown it to be a class of its own. This is a small class of about 50 species, mostly inshore and quite small. The recent discovery of some Staurozoa near deep sea hydrothermal vents was a surprise, and makes it clear that there is much more to learn about them.
The Staurozoa are unique in not having an alternation of polyp and medusa life cycle phases. They have an attached "medusa" stage, with a life style looking rather like polypoid forms. 
Members of this class are commonly found in relatively cold waters, close to the shoreline. After the larvae crawl across the sea floor and find a suitable place, they attach themselves to rocks or algae.

Alfalfa is high in protein, calcium and other minerals, vitamins in the B group, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin K. The sun-dried hay of alfalfa has been found to be a source of vitamin D, containing 48 ng/g (1920 IU/kg) vitamin D and 0.63 ng/g (25 IU/kg) vitamin D. There is reference to vitamin D and vitamin D being found in the alfalfa shoot; this is awaiting verification.

There is speculation that this spike was attached to a flap of skin that covered the nostrils and could be blown up for displays and noise-making. Many "Saurolophus" fossils have been found, including one with fossilized skin impressions, in Alberta, Canada and Mongolia, China.

"Stegoceras" was a herding dinosaur that lived in small groups in coastal and upland regions. Running was probably its first line of defense. "Stegoceras" lived during the late Cretaceous period, toward the end of the Mesozoic Era, the Age of Reptiles, about 76-65 million years ago. "Stegoceras" was first found in 1889.
Images of the insides of "Stegoceras"' fossilised skull showed two layers of dense bone that encase a spongy sinus held apart by tiny struts, has led some scientists to doubt this interpretation.
Computer tomographic (CT) scans on the skulls of "Stegoceras", along with a variety of modern animals were used to create 3D models of the animals' heads. The team was then able to exert virtual stresses to test how the different skulls held up.
Compared to some of today's big hitters, such as the Northern American bighorn sheep, Stegoceras' head was able to withstand the most stress.

<doc id="221195" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=221195" title="Lambeosaurus">
Lambeosaurus

Lambeosaurus was a crested, duck-billed dinosaur. Its large hollow, bony crest was as big as the rest of its skull. Its function has been much discussed.
"Lambeosaurus" lived during the later Cretaceous period, about 76 to 75 million years ago (mya). Fossils of it have been found in Alberta (Canada), Montana (USA), and Baja California (Mexico), but only the two Canadian species have been described in detail. Apparently, the Mexican species, "Lambeosaurus laticaudus", grew to be about 50 feet long (15 m), weighing 5.6 tons. It is the longest-known ornithischian dinosaur. The other species were smaller.
"Lambeosaurus" was described by Dr. William A. Parks in 1923, 20 years after Lawrence Lambe (an early Canadian fossil hunter) had studied it. The genus ranged over much of North America, and into Mexico.
As a hadrosaurid, "Lambeosaurus" was a large bipedal/quadrupedal herbivore, eating plants. It had a sophisticated skull that allowed a grinding motion like mammalian chewing. Its teeth were continually replaced and were packed into dental batteries that each contained over 100 teeth, only a relative handful of which were in use at any time. 
It used its beak to crop plant material, which was held in the jaws by a cheek-like organ. Feeding would have been from the ground up to around 4 meters (13 ft) above. 
Lambeosaurines have narrower beaks than hadrosaurines, which suggests that "Lambeosaurus" and its relatives could feed more selectively than their broad-beaked, crestless counterparts.
Like other lambeosaurines such as "Parasaurolophus" and "Corythosaurus", "Lambeosaurus" had a distinctive crest on the top of its head. Its nasal cavity ran back through this crest, making it mostly hollow. Many suggestions have been made for the function or functions of the crest. They include housing salt glands, improving the sense of smell, use as a snorkel or air trap, acting as a resonating chamber for making sounds, or being a method for different species or different sexes of the same species to recognize each other. Social functions such as noisemaking and recognition have become the most widely accepted of these hypotheses.
The large size of hadrosaurid eyes and the presence of sclerotic rings in the eyes imply acute vision and diurnal habits, evidence that sight was important to these animals. The hadrosaurid sense of hearing also appears to be strong. There is at least one example, in the related "Corythosaurus", of a slender stapes in place, which combined with a large space for an eardrum implies a sensitive middle ear. The auditory part of the inner ear was well-developed. If used as a noisemaker, the crest could also have provided recognizable differences for different species or sexes, because the differing layouts of the nasal passages corresponding to the different crest shapes would have produced different sounds.

Wisdom literature

Wisdom literature is a genre of literature that was common in the ancient Near East. Wisdom literature is about sayings of wisdom that teach about divinity and wisdom. The story-telling used is the same than in other forms of literature. Wisdom literature tells the reader has about how nature is made, and what reality is. 
There are two kinds of wisdom literature:
Sayings are generalized. Speculative wisdom literature are about a person, and its relationship to questions such as the meaning of life, suffering or the relationship between that person and a deity.
The Jews sometimes say the Old Testament is the Law, the Prophets, and the Writings. Included inside the Writings are Psalms and wisdom materials like Job, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes. These wisdom books are related to certain people called "wise men" who were an important part of Israelite society. ()

Map lichen

The map lichen is a species of lichen, Rhizocarpon geographicum. It grows on rocks in areas of low air pollution. Each lichen is a flat patch bordered by a black line of spores. These patches grow next to each other. This makes the lichen look like a map or a patchwork field.
Map lichen is a lichen widely used by climatologists to determine the relative age of deposits. As an example, they might use it in a moraine systems, to tell how long a rock has been exposed. With this they can also tell about glacial advances. The process is called lichenometry.
Lichenometry is based on the assumption that the largest lichen growing on a rock is the oldest individual. If the growth rate is known, the maximum lichen size will give a minimum age for when this rock was deposited. 
Growth rates for different areas and species can be obtained by measuring maximum lichen sizes on substrates of known age, such as gravestones, historic or prehistoric rock buildings, or moraines of known age (e.g. those deposited during the Little Ice Age).

Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie

Die Frau vom Checkpoint Charlie (English: The Woman of Checkpoint Charlie) is a movie in two parts about a woman who manages to escape to the west from the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), but is separated from her children. She spent six years trying to get the East German government to allow her daughters to join her in the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany). It is based on a true story. It was first shown on French-German television station ARTE on 28 September 2007.
The woman’s name was Jutta Fleck. In the movie she is called Sara Bender. She is played by the actress Veronica Ferres. Her children were called Claudia and Beate. In the movie they are called Silvia and Sabine (or “Bine” – pronounce “BEE-ne” - for short).
In 1982 Sara Bender is living with her two daughters Silvia (11) und Sabine (9) in Erfurt in the GDR (East Germany). Their mother said some things that criticized the government of their country. In a communist country like the GDR it was a bad thing to be critical of the government. Because of what their mother said, her children were treated badly at school.
Sara wants to marry Peter Koch, whom she knows at work. A wedding is arranged. Sara’s father lives in Helmstedt in the West Germany. He travels to his daughter’s wedding, but on the way he has an accident on the motorway and is seriously injured. The wedding is postponed. Sara wants to visit her father in hospital in West Germany, but the government of the GDR do not allow her to go because of the critical things she had said. Her father dies. Sara still keeps asking for permission to leave her country, but she is not allowed, and things are made difficult for her at work.
She tries to escape from the GDR with her two daughters. They manage to get to Romania, and they want to go to Yugoslavia, but they are caught by the East German secret police (Stasi). The Stasi knew they were going to try to escape because they had put secret microphones in Sara’s flat so that they could hear everything that was said. Sara and the children are brought back to East Berlin. At the airport the children are separated from their mother. They are taken to a children’s home in Dresden. Sara is locked up in a police cell. Her friend Peter, whom she had wanted to marry, turns out to be on the side of the Stasi. He works against her. Sara is sentenced to three years in prison.
After two years in prison Sara is let out, thanks to the West German government who paid the GDR to free her and let her come to the West. She is still not allowed to see her two daughters who had been sent to live with a foster family who were loyal to the communist government. Sara is tricked into signing papers which actually mean that she no longer has any rights to see her daughters.
Sara cannot bear to be in the West without her daughters. She immediately starts to beg the GDR to let her daughters join her, but nothing happens. Even the West German government does not help her, because, for political reasons, they do not want to make bad relationships with the GDR in East Berlin.
Sara thinks the only way she can make anyone take any notice of her is to get publicity. She gets help from a journalist and photographer Richard Panter. She stands at Checkpoint Charlie, the place in the middle of Berlin, where foreigners could cross over from one side of the divided city to the other. She wears a big placard which says: “Give my children back to me!”. Richard takes photographs and gets newspapers all over the world to print them. The GDR government does not like this at all. They send agents to threaten her. She is even attacked and wounded in the street, and told that next time she will be killed if she carries on her campaign. Even the FRG (West German) ask her to stop her campaign, because it is bad for international relations.
However, Sara does not stop. She manages to contact her children by smuggling letters and messages on cassettes. The girls are really cheered up and think they will soon be able to join their mother in the West. But no permission is given.
Sara travels to a conference in Helsinki where she wants to speak to Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the West German Minister for Foreign Affairs (the movie is slightly different here to what really happened). She is given a lift in a car by men who say they are taking her to Genscher, but they are Stasi agents who take her to a forest to murder her, but she manages to escape.
Her two daughters are told that their mother has been killed in a car crash, but this is a lie. The children happen to see their mother demonstrating on a television news report. They realize she is still alive. Her foster parents find a recording on a cassette on which the girls have criticized the GDR government. They are harshly punished.
In the end their foster mother feels sorry for them and helps to persuade the GDR government to let the children go. They are reunited with their mother in West Berlin.

<doc id="221291" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=221291" title="Diffusion">
Diffusion

Diffusion is a physical process where molecules of a material move from an area of high concentration (where there are many molecules) to an area of low concentration (where there are fewer molecules). 
Diffusion usually happens in a solution in gas or in a liquid. It is possible to see diffusion happening when two liquids are mixed in a transparent container. 
It describes the constant movement of particles in all liquids and gases. These particles move in all directions bumping into each other. Diffusion can only work with gases and liquids.
Here are some examples of diffusion:
Molecules tend to move from places of high concentration to places of low concentration, just by moving randomly. For example, there is more oxygen in a lung than there is oxygen in the blood so oxygen molecules will tend to move into the blood. Similarly, there is more carbon dioxide molecules in the blood than in the lung so carbon dioxide molecules will tend to move into the lung. It happens in cell biology, where small molecules simply diffuse through the cell membrane, but larger molecules only get through by using energy: see active transport.
Areas of high density are, due to the random movement of fluid molecules, likely to spread out within their boundary until they can do so no longer.

Thought disorder

In psychiatry the term thought disorder or formal thought disorder refers to a condition where people have problems with consistent and straight thinking leading to abnormalities e.g. with spoken and written language. The people who have this condition use language that is disordered, or sometimes hard to follow. According to the psychiatrists, language is a reflection of thought processes. People who have difficulty speaking therefore often also have difficulty thinking. 
Thought disorder is considered to be a symptom of psychotic mental illness, but there can also be other causes for it.
The condition it describes is permanent. It affects speech and writing. Those affected may speak all the time, or they may show patterns like switching ideas inside a sentence. They may also use different words that do not fit together at all; this is known as 'word salad'. 
Eugen Bleuler, who named schizophrenia, held that its defining characteristic was a disorder of the thinking process. However, although the delusions and hallucinations of psychosis could also be considered as disorders of thought, the term "formal thought disorder" applies specifically to the presumed disruption in the flow of conscious verbal thought that is inferred from spoken language. This is typically what is referred to when the strictly less accurate, more commonly used but abbreviated term, 'thought disorder', is used.

Amargasaurus

Amargasaurus was a sauropod from the early Cretaceous period. It grew to 10 meters (33 feet) length, which was relatively small for a sauropod. It was a quadrupedal herbivore with a long, low skull on the end of a long neck, much like its relative "Dicraeosaurus". 
"Amargasaurus" was found in La Amarga, a canyon in Neuquén Province, Argentina. 
"Amargasaurus" had two tall rows of spines on top of its backbone along the neck and back. The function of the spines is not known. They may have operated as a defence from theropod attack from above. Another idea is that they supported a sail-like structure.
The neural spines were bifurcated along their entire length, forming a double row. They were circular in cross section and tapered towards their tips. The tallest spines could be found on the middle part of the neck, where they reached 60 cm on the 8th cervical. On the neck, they were bowed backwards, projecting above the adjacent vertebra. Greatly elongated spines continue along the last two dorsal vertebrae, the hip and foremost tail. However, in these regions the spines were not bifurcated but flared into a paddle-shaped upper end.

Dunkirk evacuation

The Dunkirk evacuation sometimes called Operation Dynamo or The Miracle of Dunkirk was a British mission to rescue Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk France, from 26 May to 4 June 1940. Over 300,000 Allied soldiers were trapped in Dunkirk by the German army after the Battle of Dunkirk. For some reason, the German commander ordered a halt to the surrounded city. Winston Churchill then ordered any ship or boat available to head for Dunkirk to pick up the soldiers.
Over 900 ships participated in the evacuation, consisting mostly of fishing and pleasure boats, although there were some larger ships also taking part. Originally, their intention was to pick up 45,000 British soldiers, and it was anticipated the Germans would try to stop them. On the first day, only 7,000 soldiers were picked up from the harbour, but none from the beach. On the second day, 17,000 soldiers were evacuated including some from the beaches. On the third day, 47,000 soldiers were successfully rescued followed by 54,000 on day four, including the first French soldiers. Evacuation reached its peak on days five and six, when over 60,000 Allied soldiers escaped. By day seven, nearly all the British had left, but the boats continued to pick up 26,000 soldiers a day (nearly all French). Evacuation ended after nine days, by which time 200,000 British soldiers and 140,000 French soldiers had escaped to Great Britain.

Supersaurus

Supersaurus was a sauropod dinosaur, a relative of "Diplodocus". It was found in the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation of Colorado in 1972. 
In most respects, "Supersaurus" is similar in to "Apatosaurus", but it is less robustly built. It has elongated cervical vertebrae, resulting in one of the longest known sauropod necks. It was up to 33 to 34 meters (108 to 112 ft) in length, and a weight of 35 to 40 tons. 
A new and much more complete specimen of "Supersaurus", nicknamed 'Jimbo', WDC DMJ-021, was found in Converse County, Wyoming in 1996. It is currently being prepared and was described in 2007. Its bones are held at the Wyoming Dinosaur Center.

Air France Flight 447

Air France Flight 447 was a scheduled commercial flight from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Paris, France. The aircraft used was an Airbus A330 jet. On June 1, 2009, the A330 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, three hours and 30 minutes into the flight, killing all 228 people on board. Air France Flight 447 is currently the deadliest plane crash in Air France's history. It is the deadliest plane crash in the 21st century since the crash of American Airlines Flight 587, which occurred on November 12, 2001.
F-GZCP was an Airbus A330-203.It has two General Electric CF6-80E1A3 engines.It was delivered new from Airbus, after having its first flight on 25th February 2005, and at the time of accident, it has flown for 18870 hours, taking off and landing 2644 times.
As the flight was more than 10 hours long, there were 3 crew operating the airplane, so that each of them can take a break during the flight. The flight's captain is Marc Dubois, while the co-pilots are Pierre-Cédric Bonin and David Robert. There were 9 cabin crew onboard and 216 passengers.The nationalities of the passengers are:
! Nationality !! Passengers !! Crew !! Total
! Total (33 nationalities) !! 216 !! 12 !! 228
Air France Flight 447 took off from Rio de Janeiro International Airport for the flight to Paris at 7.29 p.m. Brazilian time. In the first part of the flight, the captain was in the left seat, while first officer Bonin was in the right seat. The third pilot, Robert, was resting in the small cabin behind the cockpit. The plane cruised at FL350, or 35,000 feet.
From 1.48 a.m. onwards, the flight went out of radar coverage. From then on ATC can no longer track the flight. At 1.55 a.m., the captain woke Robert up and asked Robert to take his place.
Then, at 2.08 a.m. the plane turned left due to turbulence. Just 2 minutes later, both the autopilot and the auto thrust switches off. Bonin, in response, said,"I have control." before raising the plane's nose up and causing the plane to climb. Robert noticed this and asked Bonin to descend. Bonin then put the nose down and the plane no longer climbed as fast as how it did previously. However, the plane was still climbing.
At about 2.11 a.m and 6 seconds, the plane reached the maximum altitude. The angle of attack was about 16 degrees. The plane stalled and began to descend. Throughout the whole descent, the angle of attack remained above 35 degrees when valid. The plane most likely crashed at 2.14 a.m. and 28 seconds, when all the recordings stopped.
At 2:20 a.m., the Air Traffic Controller at DAKAR failed to contact Air France Flight 447, which was supposed to be in DAKAR airspace already. The controller then contacted Air France, who tried to contact Flight 447, but failed. At that time, people thought that the plane had "disappeared".Ships and planes then searched the area near the last-known position of Flight 447, and by 6th June, the first bodies have been found. The plane was confirmed to have crashed.
As the search for survivors end, the search for the plane's recorders then began. Underwater Vehicles are used to detect the recorders' signals that they give out for 30 days.However, at the end of the 30 days, there was not a sign of the recorders. Other searches in 2009 and 2010 also found nothing.
Then, in 2011, the search for recorders finally ended when an underwater vehicle found the Flight Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder on 26th April and 2nd May respectively.The recorders are sent to BEA(Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile, Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety)'s headquarters for analysis and arrived on 12th May.
When the pitot tubes were blocked by ice crystals, the automatic controls of the plane, including autopilot and autothrust, switches off by itself. This had surprised the pilots, even though this was a well known phenomenon. The pilots likely never understood that the only problem they had was that the airspeed was incorrect.
The plane began to climb. During the whole climb to 38,000 feet, the crew failed to understand the situation. Even when the plane stalled and the stall warning sounded, the crew likely did not understand the stall situation they were in and so never tried to put the nose down and recover the plane from the stall. The plane remained stalled until impact with water.
Right after the crash, Air France sped up the replacement of pitot tubes. By June 11, 2009, all the pitot tubes were changed to ones that will not freeze up when ice crystals hit them.
The flight number was changed to AF 445 after the crash and is still flown by Airbus A330-200s.
There are some documentaries about the crash, including:

Pink salon

A ', or ' is a place for sex in Japan that specializes in oral sex. The client is served soft drinks and a young girl performs fellatio on him in a small room or booth. These places are very popular for young men because they are very cheap and the service is fast.
This kind of place started in the early 1960s and is an improved version of the very popular Kyaba-Kura (cabaret clubs). In these clubs a client pays to talk and drink with a girl, and in night salons a men can masturbate in front of a girl, and ejaculate into either her hands or mouth, this is all done without touching the client.
Prostitution in Japan is strictly prohibited. But if there is no penetration in the encounter it is not considered prostitution. All these kinds of places (for sex) are in special zones in each city and are often hidden under a false or cover identities like restaurants, shops or sex shops. They can be easier to spot at night when all other businesses are closed, as these ones are open.
This kind of sex place is usually in specific zones like entertainment areas or Red-light districts. Using a false name they can also be in almost every part of the city and are usually announced at the JR stations.
The inside of a pink salon is usually dark, with quiet music. At the entrance customers must disinfect their hands and specially their nails if they are long. Most salons only allow entry to Japanese people and forbid entry to strangers. There are also snacks and beer free of charge. Alcoholic beverages must be paid for.
The system of a pink salon is simple. Customers usually pay for 30–45 minutes of service, however the price depends on the time of the service. It usually costs around 2000-4000 Yen in the morning and 4000-12000 Yen at nights. The customer sits in a single sofa and a girl comes and provides the customer with service. The types of service include: genital touching, fellatio, footjob and cunnilingus. Customers do not need to wear a condom and it is common that they ejaculate in the girl's mouth.
It is also common that the fellatio is done by more than one girl, changing every 15 minutes (making a total of three girls in a 45 minute period).

The child may be put into foster care because their own parents are not able to look after them. There may be several reasons why this may happen. The parents may be very ill or unable to control their own lives, perhaps because of alcoholism or drug addiction. They may be in prison or the children may be threatened with violence in their own home. They are put into foster care so that they are safe and can live a more normal life in someone else's home.
When a child is fostered there has to be an inconsequential legal agreement. The person who looks after them instead of their own parents is called a “foster parent”. The child is made a “ward” of court, which means that power is given through the court of law to the foster parent to look after them. The foster parent(s) is “ in loco parentis”, meaning: “in the place of the parent”. They can make decisions about the child because the real parent(s) are not able to do this.
The laws about fostering children are, of course, not the same in different countries around the world.
In most Western countries fostering can sometimes be a long-term arrangement, perhaps until the child has become an adult. However, in many cases the child may be able to return to their own family later if their family life has changed.
Foster parents are paid by the state to look after the children.
Adoption is different to foster care. Adoption is taking into one's family (a child of other parents), especially by a formal legal act.
Fosterage is not the same as foster care. Some societies have arrangements whereby children are brought up in other families. This is a social matter, not a legal matter. This can be described as "fosterage".

Fosterage

Fosterage is an arrangement in which a child is brought up with a family that is not their own. It is different from foster care, which is a legal arrangement made for a child's safety. Fosterage can describe many different arrangements according to the society they belong to. In many parts of the world there are societies where the children do not live with their parents. This may be linked to the society's special way of life.

Child custody

Child custody and guardianship are legal terms which are sometimes used to describe the legal relationship between a parent and his or her child. It includes such things as the right of the parent to make decisions for the child, and the parent's duty to care for the child.
Child custody decisions have to be made in cases such as divorce, or when a child cannot be looked after by either parent and has to be put into foster care or put up for adoption. 
In general: decisions about who will have custody of a child will be taken in such a way as is best for the child.
A child may be given state custody. This may be because the child is in danger when living at home. There may, for example, be violence in the home.
When there is a divorce case, a decision will be made about whether the mother or the father has custody of the child. There may be "joint custody", which means that both parents have custody over the child.
Physical custody means: who looks after the child from day to day. It is about where a child will live. 
Legal custody means: having the power to make decisions about the child, e.g. where he or she goes to school etc.
If a child lives with one parent, that parent has "sole physical custody". He or she is the "custodial parent". The other parent is the "non-custodial parent", but they may have the right to visit the child.
The laws about child custody will vary from one country to another.

Backward compatibility

Backward compatibility refers to hardware or software that can successfully use interfaces and data from earlier versions of the system or with other systems. For example, Perl, the scripting language, was designed to be backward compatible with awk, an earlier language that Perl was designed to replace.
Backward compatibility is more easily accomplished if the previous versions have been designed to be forward compatible, or extensible, with built-in features such as hooks, plug-in, or an application program interface (API) that allows the addition of new features.
The term "backward combatible" (notice the "b") is sometimes used to describe hardware or software that is designed without regard for compatibility with earlier versions, causing the two versions to fight (or combat) each other. In this case, the two versions cannot share data easily and may have features that cause errors or crashes when they are installed on the same computer, often because the computer does not understand which version is being referred to. Even if the earlier version is removed, remaining vestiges of it may cause problems in running the newer version.

Woolly monkey

Woolly monkeys are named for their thick woolly coats. They are New World monkeys, and are found in forests along the Amazon River, and in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. Unlike other monkeys, woolly monkeys are most likely to be found on the ground. They move much more slowly than other monkeys do, too.
Woolly monkeys eat fruit, flowers, and leaves. They are quite tame, and they live in groups or bands of 10 to 30 monkeys. When frightened, woolly monkeys tend to swing through tree branches and hide. They are friendly and are often seen in the company of other kind of monkeys. When they walk on the ground, they stand straight up, and use their tails for support. They are quite harmless creatures.
Also, they tend to live in rainforests, especially the Amazonian rainforest.

Nacozari de García

Nacozari de García is a small mining town surrounded by its municipal area in the northeast of the Mexican state of Sonora. 
The area of the municipality is . In 2000, the municipality had a population of 14,363. The town is located at an elevation of .
The town is on Federal Highway 17, which connects Agua Prieta with Hermosillo. The distance to Agua Prieta is . The town is oconnected to Aguq Prieta by a railroad. There is a small airport for light aircraft. 
The land is mountainous and is part of the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains. There is a reservoir at La Angostura, which dams up the Río Bavispe (the Bavispe River). 
In 1660, copper was found in the area, and mines were created. A village was begun, called "Nuestra Señora del Rosario de Nacozari" ('Our Lady of the Rosary of Nacozari'). 
The mines were owned by the Anglo American U.B. Teader mining company in 1867. They later sold them to the Moctezuma Copper Co., which part of the Phelps Dodge company. American-style houses were built. A library and a small hospital were also built. When the mines were opened, copper was carried by mules. In 1904 the railroad was built, so the copper was moved by train. By 1907, Nacozari had become the metropolis of far northeastern Sonora. The population was 5,000 people, mostly Mexicans and Americans, with some Chinese people. Phelps kept the mines until 1948 when the copper had all been taken out.
A large mine, La Caridad, was found about southeast of Nacozari in 1968. By 1979, the population of Nacozari was about 3,000 again. The federal government spent hundreds of millions of dollars to develop La Caridad (which was also called Mexicana de Cobre). They also re-opened other mines in the area. Nacozari was estimated to have a population of 18,600 people in 1986, and 30,000 in 1989. La Caridad is ranked the third largest copper mine in the world. 
The town was first called Placeritos de Nacozari but changed its name to Nacozari de García. The town was named after the railroad engineer Jesús García, who saved the town from a dynamite explosion on 7 November 1907. There are monuments to Jesús García in many other Mexican cities and towns. November 7 is the Day of the Railroader in Mexico. Everybody who works on the railroad has a day off from work, apart from essential employees of the National Railways of Mexico. Many streets in Mexico are named Jesús García or the "Héroe de Nacozari". Poems and songs have been written about him and about the accident.
The name Nacozari is an word from the language of the Opata people who used to live in the area. It means "a lot of nopal (the fruit of the Prickly pear)".
The main source of income is from the copper mine of Mina Mexicana de Cobre, S.A de C.V, which employs most of the labor force (3,012 workers in 2000).
Cattle raising is also important with 16,375 cattle counted in the 2000 census. Calves are exported to the United States of America.

Manchester code

The Manchester code is a binary encoding which also encodes the clock signal. This is very useful, because an external clock signal is no longer needed. A sequence of bits modulates the phase of the signal. This is a form of Phase shift keying, often shortened to PSK.
Otherwise put, the information about the signal is in its signal flanks, that is when the signal changes.
Manchester codes are widely used, for example for Ethernet or for RFID. 
There are two ways to represent a Manchester code:
To rule out ambiguities, Manchester codes use a "preamble". A preamble is a fixed sequence that is known beforehand.
One of the advantages of Manchester code is that the DC component of the signal carries no information. This makes it possible that standards that usually do not carry power can transmit this information. One of the drawbacks of the encoding is that it needs more bandwidth than other encodings, such as NRZ.

Roger Waters

George Roger Waters (born 6 September 1943 is an English rock musician. He was born in Great Bookham, Surrey and moved to Cambridge during his early childhood. He is best known as the bass player, co-lead singer, principle lyricist, and founding member of the English rock band Pink Floyd (1964-1986). Waters became the primary lyrical contributor in Pink Floyd after the departure of fellow founding member Syd Barrett in January 1968, and sang lead vocals on at least one half of all Pink Floyd tracks during his tenure with the band. Many consider 1973-1979 to be the Golden Age of the Waters era Pink Floyd, during which time they released four studio albums, including two of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed rock albums ever created.
Released in 1973, "The Dark Side of the Moon" is one of the top selling albums of all time. Pink Floyd followed the epochal success of "Dark Side" with "Wish You Were Here" (1975), "Animals" (1977) and 1979's "The Wall", a double album considered by many to be rock's finest. "The Wall", based on the life struggles of Roger Waters, is the best selling double disk of all time, and as Pink Floyd's second unequivocally definitive album, it solidified their status among the world's elite rock bands. In 1983 Pink Floyd released their tenth studio album, "The Final Cut". Written and almost entirely sung by Roger, (Gilmour sang on just one track), it is the only Pink Floyd album on which Waters is credited for the writing and composition of every song. In retrospect, "The Final Cut" is more fairly considered Roger's first solo album, essentially using David Gilmour and Nick Mason as studio musicians. One of rock music's most critically acclaimed and commercially successful acts, Pink Floyd has sold over 200 million albums worldwide, including 74.5 million in the United States.
Following his legal and philosophical split with Pink Floyd in 1986, Waters began a solo career, releasing three studio albums, "The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking" (1984), "Radio K.A.O.S." (1987), and in 1992, the highly acclaimed "Amused to Death". In 1990, Roger staged one of the largest rock concerts ever, "The Wall Concert in Berlin", on the vacant terrain between Potsdamer Platz and the Brandenburg Gate. In 2005 he released the critically acclaimed opera, "Ça Ira", which would go on to top the classical charts in America and Britain, as well as joining Nick Mason, Richard Wright and David Gilmour, for an historical performance at the 2 July 2005 Live 8 concert in London's Hyde Park, Pink Floyd's first public performance with Roger in 24 years.
Waters has toured extensively as a solo act since 2005, performing "Dark Side" to sold out audiences and critical acclaim the world over. Waters' manager, Mark Fenwick, has recently confirmed that Roger is "considering" touring "The Wall" in 2010 and 2011.

Big Max

Big Max is a type of squash that can grow to be more than 100 pounds. They can also be in diameter if they are grown properly. They are commonly called pumpkins, but this is not entirely correct; Big Max are instead "squash-type pumpkins". They have a bright orange color, with fine-grained, yellow-orange flesh. The skin has deep lines in it and is slightly roughened, and can be up to thick. This makes Big Max squash good for keeping. The flesh is good for being canned and frozen. 
However, because they are so big, cooking with these squash is hard. They are said to not be as flavorful as smaller pumpkin varieties. The variety was , or created, for its large size. They have been grown as big as 300 pounds. Individual fruits are round to slightly flattened. 
These squash are best planted between two and four weeks after the average last frost, and they become ripe 110 to 120 days after being planted. The plants need lots of room to grow well, and to get them very big, only one fruit should be grown on one vine. They are harvested before the first light frost, when the plant's leaves die. Although are different, seeds are often planted at deep, spaced apart.

Dormouse

The dormouse (plural: dormice) is a rodent in the family Gliridae. Dormice live mainly in Europe, although some live in Africa and Asia. They are known for their long periods of hibernation. Only one species of dormouse normally lives in the British Isles, so there "dormouse" usually means the hazel dormouse, not the whole family of dormice.
Dormice are small rodents, with a body length of between , and weighing between . They are usually mouse-like in appearance, but they have furry tails instead of scaly tails. They are usually arboreal animals (living in trees). They move quickly and are good at climbing. Most species are nocturnal. Dormice have a very good sense of hearing. They make noises to each other with different sounds using their voices.
Dormice are omnivorous, usually eating fruits, berries, flowers, nuts and insects. Dormice are different to all other rodents because they do not have a cecum which is a part of the gut. Other animals use the cecum to ferment plants. Their teeth are like squirrels, but they often do not have premolars.
Dormice breed one or two times per year, having an average of four young after a gestation period of 21–32 days. Dormice can live for as long as five years. The young are born without hair and they cannot do anything for themselves. Their eyes do not open until about eighteen days after birth. They are usually ready to reproduce after the end of their first hibernation. Dormice live in small family groups. The area they live in depends on which species they are, and how much food is available..
One of the main characteristics of dormice that live in temperate zones is hibernation. Dormice can hibernate six months out of the year, or even longer if the weather remains cold enough. They sometimes wake for a short amount of time so that they can eat food which they had previously stored nearby. During the summer, they store fat in their bodies, to give the dormouse the energy it needs to survive through the hibernation period.
Hibernation is where the name dormouse comes from. The Anglo-Norman word "dormeus" means "sleepy (one)"; the word was later changed to resemble the word "mouse". The sleepy behaviour of the Dormouse character in Lewis Carroll's "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" also shows this trait.
The edible dormouse was thought to be a special food in ancient Rome. It was eaten as an appetizer or as a dessert. When it was eaten as a dissert, it would be dipped in honey and poppy seeds. The Romans had a special place to keep dormice which was called a "glirarium". Dormice are still eaten in Slovenia. Dormouse fat was used by the Elizabethans to induce sleep.
The earliest fossil evidence of dormice has been found in Europe from the early Eocene times. They were in Africa in the upper Miocene. Their appearance in Asia was not as long ago. Many types of extinct dormouse species have been found. During the Pleistocene, giant dormice the size of large rats (for example "Leithia melitensis") lived on the islands of Malta and Sicily.
The family consists of 34 living species, in three subfamilies and 10 genera (although not all scientists agree with this number):

The martial eagle ("Polemaetus bellicosus") is a bird of prey. It lives in Africa and is the biggest eagle in Africa, 76 to 96 cm (30–38 in) long, and its wingspan is 188–260 cm (6.2–8.5 ft) long.
Because it is so big, it can kill a small antelope called duikers and eat it, but it could not carry it up to its big nest in the tree.

Hazel dormouse

The hazel dormouse or common dormouse is "Muscardinus avellanarius". This small rodent is the only living species in its genus.
It is long with a tail of . It weighs , increasing to just before hibernation. The hazel dormouse hibernates from October to April/May. In British sources, it is normally called .the dormouse. rather than the hazel or common dormouse.
The hazel dormouse is native to northern Europe and Asia Minor. It is the only dormouse native to the British Isles, although the edible dormouse ("Glis glis") was accidentally introduced to the British Isles and now has an established population). 
The locations in the UK where the hazel dormouse can be found is shown on the National Biodivestity Network website.
The hazel dormouse is a European Protected Species and is protected in the UK under the Wildlife and Countryside Act.
The hazel dormouse is the only small mammal in Britain to have a completely furry tail. It has golden-brown fur and large black eyes. It is a nocturnal creature and spends most of its waking hours looking for food in trees. It will make long trips in tree branches instead of coming down to the ground. This is to avoid danger.
In winter (early October), the hazel dormouse will hibernate in nests beneath the leaf litter on the forest floor. When it wakes up in spring (late April or early May), it builds nests out of honeysuckle bark, fresh leaves and grasses. If the weather is cold and wet and there is not much food, it saves energy by going into torpor (a temporary hibernation). It curls up into a ball and goes to sleep. The hazel dormouse spend a large amount of its life sleeping, either hibernating in winter or in torpor in summer.
Examination of hazelnuts may show a neat round hole in the shell. This shows that it has been opened by a small rodent like the dormouse, wood mouse, or bank vole. Other animals including squirrels or jays will either split the shell completely in half or make a jagged hole in it.
If you look closer at the hole, the inner rim of the hole will have toothmarks which are at an angle to the hole (if it has been made by a dormouse). The toothmarks are parallel with rough marks on the nut surface if a wood mouse made the hole. The bank vole leaves parallel grooves with no rough marks.
It feeds on a different foods which it can find in trees:
The hazel dormouse needs different food sources at different times of year to survive.

Edible dormouse

The edible dormouse or 'fat dormouse' ("Glis glis") is a small dormouse and the only species in the genus Glis.
Fat dormice are the largest dormice in Europe. The ancient Romans used to breed them to be eaten (usually as a snack). This is the reason for the word "edible" in its name. The dormice were kept in large pits or in terra cotta containers (which were called "gliraria"), which were like modern hamster cages.
Wild edible dormice are still eaten in Slovenia, and trapping dormice is a Slovenian tradition. Using dormice for food and fur is mentioned in documents which were written in the 13th century. They also mention the use of dormouse fat as a medicine. Poor and hungry peasants would eat dormice during winter because it is a good protein source.
The edible dormouse lives in Europe. It was accidentally introduced to the town of Tring in England after some dormice escaped from the private collection of Lionel Walter Rothschild in 1902. The British edible dormouse population is about 10,000 and is found in a triangle between Beaconsfield, Aylesbury and Luton. 
This animal is seen as a pest by some people. In the United Kingdom the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 does not allow some ways of killing them, and to remove the dormice from the area may require a license.

Ophélie Bretnacher disappearance

The case of Ophélie Bretnacher's disappearance is a complex criminal and diplomatic case between France and Hungary, both members of the European Union.
Ophélie Bretnacher was a French student, at the "Reims Management School". With the European exchange programme, called "Erasmus Programme", she spent some time at the Corvinius University of Budapest. Ophélie Bretnacher disappeared in Budapest, Hungary on 4 December 2008. Coming out from a nightclub, the Portside of Cuba, she was tracked by the city video cameras part of her way. Her cellular phone and her bag were later found on the Lanchid bridge.
In the French Government, Catherine Vautrin, the Vice-Président of the National Assembly recalls the disappearance of Ophélie and asks for a French intervention. and Ophélie appears on Nicolas Sarkozy's blog.
Ophélie Bretnacher disappeared 2 and a half months after Eva Rhodes, the Yoko Ono and John Lennon model, in Hungary. Their families are planning to send a claim from the European Union and make known the fact that 4500 foreign people disappear each year in Hungary.
Good police and judicial cooperation between countries, members of the European Union is specified in the Treaty of Lisbon, applicable on 1 December 2009 and in the "Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union".
Her body was discovered in Csepel, in February 2009, in a in a backwater of the Danube. Homicide cannot be ruled out because of the finding of an hematoma on Ophelie's body as well as many gray areas during the search. 
To date, no findings have been sent by Hungary such as the forensic analysis like Diatoms and the Danube search report, despite the intervention mission twice in 2009 of French investigators in Hungary and the local investigation seems not having progressed for one year.
In February 2010, her family filed a new claim for murder. The Bretnacher family lawyer is William Bourdon, the secretary-general of the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues (1995-2000) and the lawyer of Transparency International.
In March 2010, a judicial inquiry is opened in Paris for kidnapping, sequestration, followed by murder.
One year later her friends, who were successful in raising 60 000 people on Facebook groups, from many European nations, launched a request for the second consecutive year in order to obtain some answers.
At the end of 2010, two years after her disappearance, more than 45,000 people from different countries took part to another Facebook event for Ophélie and, on December 4th, her friends announced that they will organize a new Internet mobilization: 
"We will create an event for Ophélie, every year, until full light will be shed on her disappearance and death, until justice is done !"
Two years after her disappearance, on 4 December 2010, Maitre William Bourdon, said that the investigation continues. The article also notes:
- The complete analysis of diatoms, which would have allowed knowing with certainty the location of drowning, has not been obtained yet.
- All required documents have not been sent. 
- The telephone terminals on the path of Ophélie have not been exploited yet.
- Some evidences (such as the walker who heard screams of women at the time of the disappearance was close to where her bag was found) have not been investigated further
- The body of Ophélie was located in a place against the current, and it is not possible that came from the Chain Bridge.

West Nile virus

West Nile Virus (WNV) is a virus that belongs to the genus "Flavivirus". It causes an infectious disease called "West Nile virus disease" or just "West Nile virus." WNV mainly infects birds, but it can also infect humans, horses, dogs, bats, cats, reptiles, and amphibians.
West Nile virus is spread by mosquitoes, who get the virus from birds. If a mosquito bites a bird that has WNV, and then bites a human, that person can get West Nile Virus.
West Nile virus was first discovered in 1937, in the West Nile area of Uganda, in East Africa. (This is how the virus got its name.) However, before the 1990s, there were very few cases of WNV. Then there was an outbreak in Algeria in 1994 and another in Romania in 1996. By 2004, the virus had spread to North America, the Caribbean islands, and Latin America. It continues to spread through Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East, Canada, and the United States. In 2012, one of the worst West Nile virus epidemics yet happened in the United States; 286 people died.
About 80% of people who get West Nile virus have no symptoms.
When a person does get symptoms, they usually do not appear until 2 to 15 days after the person got the virus. (This is called the virus's incubation period.)
West Nile virus can cause many different types of illness. The rarest, but most serious types affect the neurological system - the brain and the nerves. The most common type of illness caused by WNV is West Nile fever, which does not affect the neurological system.
West Nile fever happens in about 20% of people with WNV. It causes a high fever and flu-like symptoms. Usually, the symptoms are not too bad, and get better after 3 to 6 days. Symptoms may include:
Neuroinvasive disease is when the West Nile virus infects the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). This happens in less than 1% of people who get West Nile virus. However, in those people, it can cause very serious problems. These problems include:
WNV can cause some other complications that do not affect the neurological system. These complications are very uncommon. They include:
At first, a medical professional usually makes a possible diagnosis of West Nile virus based on a person's symptoms, where they live, and when and where they have traveled. The World Health Organization says that doctors should suspect West Nile virus if a patient:
West Nile virus can be diagnosed for certain by:
There is no known treatment or cure for WNV. There are no known anti-viral medications (medicines which kill viruses) which will kill the West Nile virus. Doctors can only provide "supportive care," which means they can only treat the symptoms of WNV. For example, they can give fluids through a needle placed into a vein if a person is very dehydrated; help the person breathe if needed; and give medications to prevent them from getting any other infections.
The West Nile virus stays alive in nature by getting spread back and forth between birds and mosquitoes. Birds get WNV more often than any other living things. When a mosquito bites a bird that has WNV, the mosquito gets the virus. Then, if the mosquito bites a bird that does not have WNV, the mosquito can give that bird the virus. In this way, birds and mosquitoes give the virus to each other and keep it alive.
Humans usually get West Nile virus by being bitten by mosquitoes who have gotten the virus from birds. Humans can get the virus from many different species of mosquitoes.
Though this is not common, a person with West Nile virus can give another person the virus. This can happen if:
There is no vaccine that will prevent West Nile virus. The best way for people to protect themselves against West Nile virus is to protect themselves against mosquitoes. There are many ways to do this. For example:
Scientists can trap mosquitoes and birds, and test them for West Nile virus to see if the virus is spreading in a certain area. If it is, they can do things like spray pesticides to kill mosquitoes.

Plywood is a manufactured wood which is made by gluing several thin sheets of wood together with the grain alternately running along the sheet then across it.
A common reason for using plywood instead of plain wood is its resistance to cracking, shrinking and changing shape. It is used to make a range of things from sheds, to cladding to cabinets. It is graded on the quality, from class A to class D, A being the best quality and D being the worst quality.
Makers use different kinds of softwood and hardwood and methods, to make different kinds of plywood. They are used for different purposes.

Plastid

A plastid is a self-reproducing organelle of plants and algae. A plastome is the DNA genome of a plastid. They are like tiny machines inside cells: each makes or stores important chemicals used by the plant. 
Examples of plastids are: 
Plastids in algae and hornworts may differ from plant plastids. In algae, the term "leucoplast" is used for all unpigmented plastids and their function differs from the leucoplasts of plants. 
Glaucocystophytic algae contain muroplasts, which are similar to chloroplasts except that they have a cell wall, similar to that of prokaryotes. Rhodophytic algae contain rhodoplasts, which are red chloroplasts which allow the algae to photosynthesise to a depth of up to 268 metres.
Plastids are one of the many different types of organelles in the cell. In endosymbiont theory, plastids originated as cyanobacteria. This was first suggested by Mereschkowsky in 1905. Schimper in 1883 had said chloroplasts closely resembled cyanobacteria. 
Almost all chloroplasts are thought to derive directly or indirectly from a single endosymbiotic event. Mitochondria also derive from symbiosis, but chloroplasts are found only in plants and protista. The chloroplast is surrounded by a double-layered composite membrane with an intermembrane space; further, it has reticulations, or many infoldings, filling the inner spaces. The chloroplast has its own DNA, which codes for redox proteins involved in electron transport in photosynthesis.

One scientist said that the body is mostly chemicals, so it should be healed by chemicals. Other scientists studied anatomy. By learning the positions of bones, muscles, and organs, they were able to give better treatment. The Englishman William Harvey discovered that blood is pumped by the heart, travels through the body in blood vessels, and returns back to the heart in the circulatory system. This made medical research in the 1600s much better and easy to understand. 
In the renaissance, a very important theory in medicine was the Four humours or Four temperaments. This theory began with the Ancient Greeks, and influenced medical development until the 19th century. According to the theory, the body was filled with four different substances, called "humours". When a person is healthy, these substances are in balance. When there is an imbalance between the humours, the person will be sick. The sickness can be cured by bringing the four humours back to balance. The four substances are , phlegm and blood. Galen still supported that theory, but refined it in many ways. 
Rhazes (865–925) was the first physician to show that the theory of four humors was wrong, in his "Doubts about Galen". He carried out an experiment which would upset this system: He inserted a liquid with a different temperature into the body. This would result in an increase or decrease of bodily heat, which resembled the temperature of that particular fluid. Rhazes noted that a warm drink would heat up the body to a degree much higher than its own natural temperature, The drink would therefore trigger a response from the body, rather than transferring only its own warmth or coldness to it. Avenzoar (1091–1161) carried out an experimental dissection and autopsy to prove that the skin disease was caused by a parasite. This discovery upset the theory of humorism. The removal of the parasite from the patient's body did not involve purging, bloodletting, or any other traditional treatments associated with the four humors. Ibn al-Nafis (1213–1288) then discredited the theory of four humors after his discovery of pulmonary circulation and coronary circulation.
Because there were only a few ways of studying how the body worked, early doctors did not know how to cure sickness. When a plague started, they could not really know what to do for their patients except making them a little less painful. One of their mistakes was that they thought the "air" carried the disease (which it sometimes did), or that sickness was caused by "flying venom": so, they covered their mouths or burned aromatic leaves (leaves that smelled good), but did not wash their hands after seeing a sick friend or family member.When William Harvey practiced medicine in 1618, only a few of his friends were trying to find out how the body worked, and only a few doctors believed Harvey when he said that the blood was pumped by the heart. Most people thought he was a quack (fake or bad doctor). Slowly they began to see his findings were real.
In the 17th century, Anton van Leeuwenhoek and Robert Hooke developed the light microscope. Using such a microscope, Leeuwenhoek was the first to see bacteria, in 1676. He called them "animalcules" and published his observations in a series of letters to the Royal Society. The name "bacterium" was introduced much later, by Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg in 1838.
However, there were still lots of strange "cures". For instance, in his medical book "Rosa Angelica", John Gadesen wrote how he treated smallpox in the son of Edward II by putting him in a red room because "red cures red". It was thought by many people that red diseases could be cured by having the patient look at the color red. 
Also, doctors said that "if an adder (snake) strike (bite) a man, wash a black snail in holy water, and give to the sick to drink." Today, of course, doctors do not use this cure.
Some cures not only didn't work, they could be dangerous to the patient. For instance, when someone was sick, doctors said that bad blood must be removed. To remove the bad blood, the doctor attached leeches to the patient (leeches are animals that suck blood). When the leech was full, the job was finished. But when somebody was sick, taking away their blood could make them very weak - they could even die. As science and medicine grew better, leeching was stopped until recently, when doctors began sometimes using leeches on patients who had fingers or hands that were cut off and reattached. One of the greatest pains in reattachment is just after surgery, when the blood pools under the skin and is very painful. Doctors have found out that using leeches to drink the excess blood helps to make the pain smaller.
Some cures really worked, though. Sometimes wounds that today we would use stitches were held together using beetles that had . The edges of the wound were pinched together by a big, angry beetle. When the pincers were pinching it firmly together, the beetle head would be cut off. Spider webs were used to help wounds clot (blood come together). Doctors are still looking into other "cures" that were used in the Renaissance to see if they can help today's medicine.

Mixotroph

A mixotroph is an organism that can use a mix of different sources of energy and carbon. Usually this means that it may be either autotroph or heterotroph at different times in its life. Also possible are alternations between photo- and chemotrophy, or between litho- and organotrophy. Mixotrophs can be either eukaryotes or prokaryotes.

Control of fire by early humans

When humans first learned how to control fire, it was an important step in their culture. It allowed humans to cook food and get warmth and protection. Making fire also allowed activity into the dark, and gave some protection from predators and insects.
The cooking of food was probably the most useful effect of fire. There are foods like meat and fruits which do not need cooking, but others, such as root vegetables, mostly need cooking.
We do not know for sure when this step was taken. "Fire was first controlled by humans anywhere from about 230,000 years ago to 1.4 or 1.5 million years ago, depending on which evidence you accept as definitive". 
Evidence for the use of fire by "Homo erectus" beginning some 400,000 years ago has wide scholarly support.
Claims for the earliest definitive evidence of control of fire by a member of "Homo" range from 0.2 to 1.7 million years ago (mya).
The earliest evidence of humans using fire comes from many archaeological sites in East Africa, like Chesowanja near Lake Baringo, Koobi Fora, and Olorgesailie in Kenya. The evidence at Chesowanja is red clay shards that scientists are 1.42 million years old. Scientists reheated some of the shards at the site, and found that the clay must have been heated to 400 °C to harden.
At Koobi Fora, there are archaeological sites with evidence of control of fire by "Homo erectus" 1.5 million years ago, with the reddening of sediment that can only come from heating at 200—400 °C. There is a hearth-like depression at a site in Olorgesailie, Kenya. Some very tiny charcoal was found, but it could have come from a natural brush fire.
In Gadeb, Ethiopia, fragments of welded tuff that seemed to have been burned were found in Locality 8E, but re-firing of the rocks may have happened because of volcanoes erupting nearby. These have been found among Acheulean artifacts made by "H. erectus".
In the Middle Awash River Valley, cone-shaped depressions of reddish clay were found that could be made by temperatures of 200 °C. These features are thought to be burned tree stumps such that they would have fire away from their habitation site. There are also burnt stones in the "Awash Valley", but volcanic welded tuff is also in the area.
The earliest certain evidence of human control of fire was found at Swartkrans, South Africa. Many burnt bones were found among Acheulean tools, bone tools, and bones with cut marks that were made by hominids. This site also shows some of the earliest evidence of "H. erectus" eating meat. The Cave of Hearths in South Africa has burned deposits dated from 0.2 to 0.7 mya, as do many other places such as Montagu Cave (0.058 to 0.2 mya and at the Klasies River Mouth (0.12 to 0.13 mya.
The most powerful evidence comes from Kalambo Falls in Zambia where many things related to the use of fire by humans had been found, like charred wood, charcoal, reddened areas, carbonized grass stems and plants, and wooden implements which may have been hardened by fire. The place was dated through radiocarbon dating to be at 61,000 BP and 110,000 BP through amino acid racemization.
Fire was used to heat silcrete stones to increase their works before they were knapped into tools by Stillbay culture. This clue shows this not only with Stillbay sites that date back to 72,000 BP but sites that could be as old as 164,000 BP.
An important change in the behavior of humans happened because of their control of fire and the light that came from the fire. Activity was no longer restricted to the daylight hours. Some mammals and biting insects avoid fire and smoke. Fire also led to better nutrition though cooked proteins.
Richard Wrangham of Harvard University argues that cooking of plant foods may have caused the brain to get bigger, because it made complex carbohydrates in starchy foods easier to digest. This made humans absorb more calories.
Stahl thought that because some parts of plants, like raw cellulose and starch are hard to digest in uncooked form, they would likely not be a part of the hominid diet before fire could be controlled. These parts include stems, mature leaves, enlarged roots, and tubers. Instead, the diet was made up of the parts of the plants that were made of simpler sugars and carbohydrates such as seeds, flowers, and fleshy fruits. Another problem was that some seeds and carbohydrate sources are poisonous. Cyanogenic glycosides, which are in linseed, cassava, and manioc, amongst others, are made non-poisonous through cooking. The teeth of "H. erectus" and the wear on the teeth reflect the consumption of foods such as tough meats and crisp root vegetables.
The cooking of meat, as can be seen from burned and blackened mammal bones, makes the meats easier to eat. It is also easier to get the nutrition from proteins because the meat itself is easier to digest. The amount of energy needed to digest cooked meat is less than that needed for raw meat, and cooking gelatinizes collagen and other connective tissues as well, it "opens up tightly woven carbohydrate molecules for easier absorption." Cooking also kills parasites and food poisoning bacteria.

Interval (mathematics)

In mathematics, an interval is a group of numbers that includes all numbers between the beginning and the end. Numbers that are larger than the beginning number and smaller than the end number are inside the interval, and numbers that are smaller than the beginning number or larger than the end number are not in the interval. The beginning number and end number may or may not be inside the interval. An example of an interval might be from 3.3 to 15. Numbers such as 4, 8, 9.5, 14, and even 14.999 are inside this interval. Numbers such as -4, 2, 3.2, 20, and 15.000001 are not inside this interval.
To write an interval, write either a square bracket ( [ ) or a parenthesis ( ( ), the beginning number, a comma ( , ), the end number, and either a closing square bracket ( ] ) or a closing parenthesis ( ) ). Examples of intervals are (4, 9.6), [-100, 100], [-30, -4).
Intervals can be separated by how they act at their ends. Intervals can be closed, open, or mixed.
An interval that is closed also includes the beginning and the end. A closed interval that has 3 as the beginning and 5.4 as the end would include 3, 5.4, and every number between 3 and 5.4. To write a closed interval, use square brackets ( [ and ] ). An example of an closed interval is [136, 450].
An interval that is open does not include the beginning or the end. An open interval that has 3 as the beginning and 5 as the end would include every number between 3 and 5, but it would not include 3 or 5. To write an open interval, use parentheses ( ( and ) ). An example of an open interval is (2, 5).
A mixed interval is open at one end and closed at the other end. This means that the interval may include the beginning but not the end, or it may include the end but not the beginning. The interval [9, 23) would include 9, but it would not include 23.

The Linnean Society was started in 1788. It was named after the Swedish naturalist Carolus Linnaeus. The Society is based at Burlington House in Piccadilly, London. Members can be a "Student member", an "Associate member" or a "full Fellow". To become a member, a person needs to be nominated by two or more Fellows, and succeed in an election. Fellows of the society can use the letters "FLS" after their names to show their membership of the Society (for example, "John Smith FLS").
The Linnean Society of London wants to promote the study of all areas of the biological sciences. They especially want to promote the study of evolution, taxonomy, biodiversity and sustainability. The Society awards medals and grants to help with this.
The following medals and prizes are awarded by the Linnean Society:
Linnaeus' botanical and zoological collections were bought in 1783 by Sir James Edward Smith, the first President of the society. They are held in London by the Society. The collections include 14,000 plants, 158 fish, 1,564 shells, 3,198 insects, 1,600 books and 3,000 letters and documents. If you want to see them, you need to make an appointment.

Guy Dollman

Captain John Guy Dollman BA, FLS (1886-1942) (who was known as Guy Dollman) was a British zoologist and taxonomist. Dollman's Tree Mouse and Dollman's Vlei Rat are named after him.
Guy Dollman was the eldest son of the artist John Charles Dollman. He was born on 4 September 1886 and went to St Paul's School. He later went to St John's College Cambridge. In February 1907, when he was still a student, he was employed by the Department of Zoology at the British Museum (Natural History). He spent most of his working life there as Assistant Keeper of Mammals.
In 1912, on an expedition to Vietnam, he discovered and named the Tonkin Snub-nosed Langur. He joined the British Army in 1915, and obtained a commission in the 19th London Regiment. He was injured in a bomb accident so he did not fight in the First World War.
In 1919, he returned to the museum. He was an adviser to the British group at the 1933 International Conference for the Preservation of the Flora and Fauna of Africa. This was the most important meeting about protecting nature before the Second World War. Dollman helped to decide which animal species needed protecting.
He travelled and wrote a lot with Walter Rothschild. Some of their writing included "New mammals from Dutch New Guinea" (which was published in 1932) and a book about tree kangaroos which was called "The Genus Dendrolagus" (which was published in 1936). He was also a very good artist, showing pictures at the Royal Academy. He also drew pictures for his own scientific writings.
Dollman died on 21 March 1942 when he was 65 years old.
Dollman is the binomial authority (the first person to name a species) for the following animals:

Nicolas Desmarest (16 September 1725 – 20 September 1815) was a French geologist.
Desmarest was born at Soulaines in the department of Aube in France. He was educated at the college of the Oratorians of Troyes and Paris. While doing this, he earned money by teaching, to pay for his education. 
Buffon's "Theory of the Earth" interested him, and in 1753 he won a prize by writing an essay on the ancient connection between England and France. A lot of people were interested in this. He was given job studying and reporting on manufacturing in different countries. In 1788 he became inspector-general of the industries of France.
Demarest travelled around on foot to learn more about the Earth's structure. In 1763 he noticed that the basalt rocks in Auvergne were old lava streams. He noticed that they were similar to the columns of the Giant's Causeway in Ireland. He knew that they were evidence of the operations of old volcanoes which were no longer active. 
In 1774 he published an essay on the subject (with a geological map) after visiting the area a few times. He then discussed the changes that the rocks had gone through because of weathering and erosion. This was the first time that anyone had talked about valleys being made because streams which flowed through them eroding the rocks.
He died in Paris in 1815. In 1823 his son Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest published a new and better edition of his map.

A clergyman is an ordained minister of the Anglican Church, or of some other Protestant churches. 'Vicar' and 'pastor' are other possibilities. 'Rector' is used in some Scottish Presbyterian churches. 'The clergy' is often used as a group term. The word 'cleric', meaning a clerk, is the root term. It comes from the fact that all clerics could read and write, at a time when this was a rare skill.
By general use and convention, Anglican ministers are not called priests. This is because the unqualified term 'priest' or 'father' is widely used as referring to the Catholic Church. Of course, in modern times an Anglican minister may be female, in which case the term 'reverend' or 'minister' may be used.

Endemism is an ecological word meaning that a plant or animal lives only in a particular location, such as a specific island, habitat type, nation or other defined zone. For example, many species of lemur are endemic to the island of Madagascar. 
There are two types of endemism - paleoendemism and neoendemism. "Paleoendemism" means that a species used to live in a large area but now lives only in a smaller area. "Neoendemism" means that a species has recently appeared which is closely related to the main species or one that has formed following hybridization and is now classified as a separate species. This is a common process in plants especially those which exhibit polyploidy.
The opposite of endemism is cosmopolitan distribution.
Endemic types are most likely to develop on islands because they are isolated. This includes remote island groups, like the Hawaiian Islands, the Galápagos Islands, and Socotra. Endemism can also occur in areas which are separated from other similar areas like the highlands of Ethiopia, or large bodies of water like Lake Baikal.
Endemics can easily become endangered or extinct because of only living in a small area. They are also vulnerable to the actions of man, including the introduction of new organisms. There were millions of both Bermuda petrels and "Bermuda cedars" (actually junipers) in Bermuda when it was settled at the start of the 17th century. By the end of the century, the petrels were thought to be extinct. Cedars, whose numbers were low as a result of centuries of shipbuilding, were nearly made extinct in the 20th Century by the introduction of a parasite. Both petrels and cedars are very rare today, as are other species endemic or native to Bermuda.
Endemic organisms are not the same as indigenous organisms — a species that is indigenous to somewhere may be native to other locations as well. An introduced species, also known as a naturalized or exotic species, is an organism that is not indigenous to a given place or area.
According to the World Wildlife Fund, the following ecoregions have the highest percentage of endemic plants:
Some of the principal threats to these special ecosystems are:

Namtap

The Namtap or Spectacled Dormouse (Graphiurus ocularis) is a species of rodent in the Gliridae family, and one of the four Dormouse species which are endemic to South Africa. 
The Namtap has a bushy tale like a squirrel, a fairly short muzzle (the part of the Dormouse's head which includes the nose, mouth and jaws), small ears and soft fur. Its face has white and grey marks, with dark rings (like spectacles) around its eyes. Its cheeks, underparts and the upper surfaces of its paws are white. Its tail is usually has a white tip. 
It is only found in western South Africa. It can usually be found in rocky habitats, as well as in trees and outbuildings. It is nocturnal and it is good at climbing. It mainly eats seeds, other plant material and invertebrates.

Arduino

Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for artists, designers, hobbyists and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments.
Arduino can sense the environment by receiving input from a variety of sensors and can affect its surroundings by controlling lights, motors, and other actuators. The microcontroller on the board is programmed using the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring) and the Arduino development environment (based on Processing). Arduino projects can be stand-alone or they can communicate with software running on a computer (e.g. Flash, Processing, MaxMSP).
The boards can be built by hand or purchased preassembled; the software can be downloaded for free. The hardware reference designs (CAD files) are available under an open-source license, you are free to adapt them to your needs.
Arduino received an Honorary Mention in the Digital Communities section of the 2006 Ars Electronica Prix. The Arduino founders are: Massimo Banzi, David Cuartielles, Tom Igoe, Gianluca Martino, and David Mellis. Credits
The machine part is open source, which means that anybody can make their own version of an Arduino machine for free. An official arduino costs around US$30. The original Arduino is made by a company in Italy called "Smart Projects" but other types of Arduino boards have been designed by SparkFun Electronics, an American company.
Sometimes, people will make other machines that go on top of an Arduino board and let the board do more things. These are called "Arduino shields". They can do different things, like let an Arduino machine connect to the internet, or add a touchscreen, or let an Arduino use GPS to figure out where it is. Shields can also combine and stack on top of each other.
Arduinos are programmed in C or C++, using a program also called Arduino. An example program to blink a light (LED) could look like this:
First, the code after "void setup() {" runs. This tells the arduino that pin 13 is going to be sending data out. Most Arduino boards have an LED attached to pin 13. Then, the code after the "void loop () {" runs. When it reaches the bottom, the code after the "void loop" runs again, until the Arduino is turned off. This code makes the Arduino tell the LED to turn on, wait a second, then turn off and wait another second. Since it repeats, this code will turn the LED on and off again and again.

Oldfield Thomas

Michael Rogers Oldfield Thomas (usually known as "Oldfield Thomas") FRS (February 21, 1858 – June 16, 1929) was a British zoologist.
Thomas worked at the Natural History Museum in their mammals department. He described about 2,000 new species and sub-species for the first time. He was given a job in the Museum Secretary's office in 1876. In 1878 he moved to the Zoological Department. In 1891 Thomas married a woman who was an heiress to a large amount of money. Having this money allowed him to hire mammal collectors and to give their specimens to the museum. In 1896 when William Henry Flower took control of the Department he hired Richard Lydekker to rearrange the exhibitions. This gave Thomas the time to concentrate on these new specimens. He committed suicide in 1929 when he was 71 years old. This was not long after the death of his wife.

Twin paradox

The twin paradox in physics is a thought experiment in special relativity. It involves identical twins, one of whom makes a journey into space in a high-speed rocket and returns home to find that the twin who remained on Earth has aged more. 
The paradox depends upon the unspoken idea that the passage of time is the same in all circumstances. But this is not correct. Time is relative and the speed of light through a vacuum is the only constant. And the universe is relativistic, not Newtonian. Every single test which has been made has shown this.

Centriole

The centriole is a cytoplasmic structure in most eukaryote cells. It is involved in cell division and in the formation of cilia and flagella. Centrioles are not found in vascular plants and in most fungi.
Most centrioles are nine sets of microtubule triplets, arranged in a cylinder. A pair of centrioles, arranged perpendicularly and surrounded by a mass of dense material makes up the centrosome.

<doc id="222226" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=222226" title="Centrosome">
Centrosome

In cell biology, the centrosome is an organelle that is the main place where cell microtubules are organized. They occur only in plant and animal cells. Also, it regulates the cell division cycle, the stages which lead up to cell division. 
The centrosome was discovered by Edouard Van Beneden in 1883, and was described and named in 1888 by Theodor Boveri. 
The centrosome has apparently only evolved in metazoan eukaryotic cells. Fungi and plants use other structures to organize their microtubules. Although the centrosome has a key role in efficient mitosis in animal cells, it is not necessary.
A centrosome is composed of two centrioles at right angles to each another. They are surrounded by a shapeless mass of protein.
The centrosome is copied only once per cell cycle so that each daughter cell inherits one centrosome, containing two centrioles. The centrosome replicates during the interphase of the cell cycle. During the prophase of mitosis, the centrosomes migrate to opposite poles of the cell. The mitotic spindle then forms between the two centrosomes. Upon division, each daughter cell receives one centrosome. 
Interestingly, centrosomes are not required for the progression of mitosis. When the centrosomes are irradiated by a laser, mitosis proceeds with a normal spindle. In the absence of the centrosome, the microtubules of the spindle are focused by motors allowing the formation of a bipolar spindle. Many cells can completely undergo interphase without centrosomes.
Although centrosomes are not required for mitosis or survival of the cell, "they are required for survival of the organism". Cells without centrosomes lack certain microtubules. With centrosome the cell division is much more accurate and efficient. Some cell types arrest in the following cell cycle when centrosomes are absent, though this doesn't always happen.

Vesicle

A vesicle is a bubble of liquid within a cell. More technically, a vesicle is a small, intracellular, membrane-enclosed sac that stores or transports substances within a cell. Vesicles form naturally because of the properties of lipid membranes. Vesicles can fuse with the plasma membrane, and release their contents outside the cell. Vesicles can also fuse with other organelles within the cell. 
A vesicle is sometimes formed when the cell is doing endocytosis. Endocytosis is a process in which a cell's membrane takes in a particle from the outside and brings it inside the cell with a vesicle around it.

Cytoskeleton

The cytoskeleton is a kind of scaffolding present in all cells. It is made of protein.
It keeps cell shape, protects the cell and enables cells to move (using structures such as flagella and cilia). It helps transport inside the cytoplasm (the movement of vesicles and organelles, for example), and in cell division. The concept and the term ("cytosquelette", in French) was introduced by French embryologist Paul Wintrebert in 1931.
Eukaryote cells contain three main kinds of cytoskeletal filaments, which are "microfilaments" (actin filaments), "intermediate filaments", and "microtubules". They give the cell structure and shape. Cytoskeletal elements interact closely and often with the cell membrane and the endoplasmic reticulum.

Garden Dormice are usually in length, with the tail adding another . It weighs . The coat is gray or brown and it is white underneath. The garden dormouse has black eye marks, large ears (for a rodent), short hair, and a white tassel at the end of the tail.
The garden dormouse's "main" habitat is the forest (and not usually gardens), though it can also be found in fruit-growing regions. It is very common in southern Europe, but its range (the area in can be found) goes up to the north of Europe. Garden dormice are often found in the Alps, in the Bavaria Forest, and in the Ore Mountains. 
The species can also be found in northern Germany, but the population there is low. In the Netherlands, it is nearly extinct. In 2007 only nine animals were found in two woods in Limburg. It used to be very common in this area. Scientists
think that his is because the landscape has changed. They also think that climate change might be a reason, because it interrupts the Dormice's hibernation.
Garden dormice are mostly nocturnal. They sleep in spherical nests in trees during the day. At night they look for food like larger insects (grasshoppers and beetle), snails, eggs, baby birds, small mice, and spiders. They also eat berries, fruit, and nuts (like acorns and beechnuts). While omnivorous, the diet of dormice contains a bit more animal protein than vegetation.
The mating period is from April to June. To show that she is ready for mating, the female squeaks loudly. The babies are usually born in litters of three to seven, after a gestation period of 23 days. The babies are blind and have no fur when they are born. They open their eyes after about eighteen days. They are nursed until they are one month old. When they are two months old, they live on their own. They become ready to mate when they are a year old. They will normally live for about five years.
Male Garden dormice may eat a rival dormouse during the mating season. Cannibalism sometimes happens when the animal is coming out of hibernation.
On the islands of the Mediterranean Sea there are a few subspecies of garden dormouse. They are all very hard to find. These subspecies are:
The Garden dormice in western Asia and north Africa have been separated into their own species "Eliomys melanurus".

Centromere

The centromere is a special region of a chromosome, usually near the middle. It is where the two identical sister chromatids stay in contact as the chromosome attaches to the spindle in mitosis. The region contains specific types of DNA, which are tandem repetitive sequences (satellite DNA). These sequences bind specific proteins called "cen"-proteins. 
During mitosis the centromeres can be seen during the "metaphase" stage as a constriction at the chromosome. At this centromeric constriction the two halves of the chromosome, the sister chromatids, are held together until late metaphase.

Rhizobia

Rhizobia are soil bacteria which become established inside root nodules of legumes (the pea family: Fabaceae). 
They fix nitrogen in a form the plant can use. Rhizobia require a plant host; they cannot independently fix nitrogen. The relationship is a classic example of symbiosis and mutualism.
The word rhizobia comes from the English root for root (rhizo) and the Ancient Greek for life (bios).

Paul Steinitz

Paul Steinitz (born Chichester, 25 August 1909; died Old Oxted, Surrey, 21 April 1988) was an English conductor and organist. He was one of the first musicians in the 20th century to make a careful study of the way that music by Johann Sebastian Bach should be performed so that it would sound like it used to in Bach’s day, in the early 18th century. He started a choir called the London Bach Society and a group of instrumentalists called the Steinitz Bach Players. He conducted them in lots of concerts. During the space of 25 years he performed all the cantatas of J.S. Bach in London. There are over 200 of them.
Paul Steinitz was born in Chichester, West Sussex, in the south of England in 1909. His father was an Anglican clergyman. He became a student at the Royal Academy of Music, studying under George Oldroyd. He was a very good organist and got his FRCO diploma in 1930. In the 1930s he was Director of Music at the church of St. Mary's Ashford, Kent. There he became very interested in the music of Bach while studying for his Doctorate 
In 1946 he started the London Bach Society. Then he became Director of Music and organist at the Priory Church of St. Bartholomew-the-Great in London, which was a very old church, a lecturer at University of London and a Professor at the Royal Academy of Music.
When Paul Steinitz founded the London Bach Society he wanted them to perform Bach’s music. Most musicians in those days played Bach in an exaggerated, romantic style, using large choirs and orchestras, playing with lots of vibrato, and with lots of changes of speed which Bach would not have done. Steinitz wanted to show people how Bach’s works should sound. From 1950 he performed them in German. When more musicians started to learn how to play period instruments he started to use these. In 1952 he conducted the first performance in Britain of Bach’s St Matthew Passion in its complete and original German form. It was all part of a movement which was known as “Back to Bach in its original form”.
In 1958 he started to perform all the 208 Bach cantatas that are known (it is thought 100 have been lost). He finished this project in 1987, shortly before he died. He got together a group of players which he called the Steinitz Bach Players. They were professional musicians who agreed with what Steinitz was trying to do. Every Lent they performed one of the two great Bach passions: the St Matthew Passion, or sometimes the St John Passion. He took the choir and his orchestra on tour to the USA, Israel, German Democratic Republic (twice, including performances at Bach’s own church, the St. Thomas' Church Leipzig) and Bulgaria.
Steinitz did not just perform Bach’s music. He conducted music by many Baroque composers as well as modern composers such as Igor Stravinsky, Peter Maxwell Davies, John Tavener, Stanley Glasser (sung in Zulu) and his own pupil Nicholas Maw.
Steinitz wrote a lot about music. He wrote a chapter on 18th century German church music in "The New Oxford History of Music", he wrote several books to show students how to write harmony, and books on how to perform Bach’s music called "Bach’s Passions", "Bach for Choirs", and "Performing Bach’s Vocal Music".
Paul Steinitz had many honours. He was a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Music and Royal College of Organists. He was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1985, the year in which Bach’s 300th birthday was celebrated.
At the end of his concerts, when the audience applauded, he would often hold up a picture of Bach, so that the audience was thanking Bach for his music.
Dr. Steinitz died in April 1988 at home in his lovely 18th century cottage in Old Oxted, just south of London. He was a Quaker who believed strongly that music could help to bring peace in the world.
There is a public memorial to him in the Cloister of St Bartholomew-the-Great, West Smithfield, London.
Today Steinitz’ wife Margaret continues her husband's work with the London Bach Society, of which Steinitz Bach Players is an integral part. To reflect modern Bach scholarship and continue Dr. Steinitz's work along the lines he had planned, the original choir was disbanded to make way for smaller professional choirs - more Bach in its original form. She also founded an annual Bachfest in 1990, which is presented each autumn.

London Bach Society

The London Bach Society is a society devoted to performing the music of Johann Sebastian Bach.
The London Bach Society was started in 1946 by Paul Steinitz because he wanted to perform Bach in a style which was like the way it sounded in Bach's time. Bach lived from 1685 to 1750. By the 20th century a lot of things had changed in music. Choirs and orchestras were much bigger and instruments were made differently. Steinitz wanted to get back to the sort of sound that Bach would have known. He started a choir called the London Bach Society so that they could give concerts of Bach's music, making it sound much clearer than it did with huge, romantic choirs.
The choir was formed in 1947. The singers were good amateur singers. Steinitz rehearsed them a lot until they were very good. The London Bach Society (LBS) gave many concerts of Bach's music, as well as singing music by other Baroque composers such as Handel, Telemann and Heinrich Schütz. They also sang works by modern composers such as Stravinsky, John Tavener and Nicholas Maw. Between 1958 and 1987 the LBS choir performed all the cantatas by Bach which survive. 208 of them are known. Many others have been lost. The choir performed one of Bach's passions every Lent, usually the "St Matthew Passion". They also went on tour, travelling to the USA, Israel, Bulgaria and twice to the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) where they sang at St Thomas Church, Leipzig, where Bach had been Director of Music.
In 1968 Steinitz got a group of players together, calling them the Steinitz Bach Players. They were professional musicians who understood how to play Baroque music. Gradually he was able to add more and more historical instruments to his concerts, such as the natural/clarino trumpet, oboe da caccia, baroque flute and sackbuts. By 1985 there were enough professional players of Baroque instruments in England for the LBS choir to be able to perform the St Matthew Passion with a complete orchestra of period instruments in Wells Cathedral and later in 1987 at Westminster Abbey
After Steinitz's death in 1989 there was no more choir, but the society still continues. Today they organize a festival of Bach's music every year, called "Bachfest" (German for "Bach Festival").

Rodgau

Rodgau is a city in the Offenbach Rural District in the state of Hesse, Germany. It is the largest city of the district by area and by population as well.
Rodgau is in the "Rhine Main area" 30 km southeast of Frankfurt am Main. The whole area of the town is 65.04 km large and it is 130 m above sea level. It is a plain area with no hills.
About 35 to 20 million years ago in the age of tertiary the whole region was lying under sea level. At that time it was covered by an ocean which was warm and not very deep. Lots of sediments sank to its bottom. Then the region rose again and the water left, leaving soil which is mostly sandy and poor.
The town consists out of 5 former independent villages. On 1 January 1977 they were united and became the "municipality of Rodgau". On 15 September 1979 city rights were given to the municipality.
The former villages, now urban districts, are from north to south: Weiskirchen, Hainhausen, Jügesheim, Dudenhofen and Nieder-Roden. They all lie by a small creek, the "Rodau", flowing through the city from south to north. Rodgau got its name from this creek. The ending "-gau" means "area" or "district". "Rod-" is a hint to the former landscape. The German verb "roden" means "cutting down trees to cultivate land". "Rod-" is also part of the name of Nieder-"Rod"en.
The neighbours of Rodgau are: 
Rodgau has 43,047 inhabitants (2008). Nearly 10% of the people living here are from foreign countries. They come from 52 different nations. 39% of the people are of catholic religion, 25.5% are of protestant religion and 35.5% have another or no religion.
The climate of the town is mild with an average temperature of 10.5 °C. There is less rain than in other parts of Germany.
Some local people are speaking a regional type (dialect) of the German language with a certain tone and special words. It is a Hessian dialect (German: "Hessisch"). This language type is related to other dialects in the south of Germany. In former times mostly every village had its own special dialect, sometimes hard to understand for people of other parts of Germany. Today the dialect speakers are a minority and the majority of them does not speak the real dialect. They rather speak a kind of regular German with a certain pronunciation.
The first settlements were build in the 8th century. Later in the 12th and 13th century the names of the settlements were written down in documents. During the times the villages belonged to different owners. Because of the reformation the people of the village of "Dudenhofen" became protestant, but all the others remained catholic. This led to the situation, that the Dudenhofen people married partners from nearby Babenhausen, Dietzenbach and other protestant places but did not have relatives in the catholic Rodgau villages. Around 1830 the settlements had a total population of about 4,000 people. In 1939 the amount of inhabitants was about 11,500. It increased to about 34,000 in 1970 and to about 45,000 at the end of the 2000s.
Formerly the people in the Rodgau area were farmers and craftsmen but not tradesmen. Every family had land to grow their food. When the property was handed to the next generation it was divided within the children. Therefore most families had only small farms and were poor. With the industrial revolution the Rhine Main area got lots of factories and developed to a center for metal working and leather manufacturing, also chemical engineering. Many men got workmen and found a job in the factories and earned money. This increased living conditions partly.
After world war II the Rhine Main area was one of the hot spots in Germany because of its central location and its traffic opportunities. Many companies settled down because of the Rhine Main airport and the motorways connecting the region with all parts of Germany. From the 1960s on the Rodgau villages were a huge development area, especially in Nieder-Roden and Jügesheim. Lots of small and middle seized companies started or moved to the area giving jobs to the people. Houses were built and people from other parts of Germany or from other countries came to the area for working and living. The fields near the villages were needed for building and the prices for the land exploded in the 1970s. All this increased the living conditions dramatically.
The growing villages formed an urban areal and in the late 1970s the municipality of Rodgau was shaped. Since then the former villagers and the new residents slowly began to develop a Rodgau identity. Most of the foreign people at first came from Italy, Spain and Portugal, later from Yugoslavia and Greece, then from Turkey. Often the male members came to earn money and send it to their family abroad. In many cases the families moved to Germany later, settled down and got German citizens, bought houses or built one. Only few went back to their home countries. The children went to German schools and are nowadays regular members of the community.
The administration of the formerly independent villages was centralized and the new city hall is in the central part of Rodgau, Jügesheim. There are citizen offices in every former village, called "Anlaufstelle" to deal with minor affairs.
Head of the city is a mayor (CDU). The parliament has 45 seats. Last elections in 2006 had the following results:
Rodgau is ruled by a "center-right" alliance of CDU and FDP. 
The city government and the mayor got problems because after the parliament elections three members of the CDU delegates left the CDU parliamentary group. The following political trouble influenced the later mayor elections (2009) and led to a new mayor, now from the SPD. He will start in April 2010.
The coat of arms was given to the city in 1978. It stands for the former villages and their religion. From bottom left to top right runs a silvery band. It is the picture of the creek "Rodau". The fife stars on the band are the picture of the fife villages lying by the creek.
Top left is the picture of a luther rose. It is a religious symbol and it stands for the protestant religion of Dudenhofen. Bottom right is a picture of a wheel. This is not a religious symbol. But it stands for the catholic religion of Weiskirchen, Hainhausen, Jügesheim and Nieder-Roden.
Both pictures are standing for the former owners of the villages. The rose stands for the Count of Hanau and later the Count of Darmstadt. The wheel comes from the archbishop of Mainz. The rose is on one side of the creek and the wheel is opposite to it on the other side of the creek. This means that the villages had trouble and fights because of their different religion.
The two main fields of Rodgau culture are the surrounding nature and the peoples clubs. It is typically German, that most of the people of Rodgau are a member of one or more of the clubs.
These associations have a focus on singing, sports, orchestra music, socker, breeding pet animals, dancing and many other. There are about 50 clubs in Rodgau, where people come together and spend their free time. The associations are an important part of the social life of the city, especially for the people of the former villages partly to keep their villager identity. The clubs are open to new members, who like to share the focus and to develope social contacts.
Rodgau is surrounded by large forests. On weekend many people go there for a walk or make trips by bicycle on the narrow lanes which are leading all through the woods. Often there are places for doing sports or having a barbecue. The facilities are kept kleen and in order by work departments of the city administration.
Because of the village history there are no theaters or museums in the city, but there are well known ones in the cities nearby, mostly in Frankfurt (Senckenbergmuseum; on natural history), Offenbach (Ledermuseum; on leather handycraft and artswork) and Darmstadt (Theater). There are no famous buildings in Rodgau but some architecture (stile of buildings) typical for the region. The old churches of the villages and the framework houses are worth to look at.
There are five protestant and six catholic churches in the city. For the Muslim there are two mosques, one in Nieder-Roden and one in Jügesheim.
Rodgau has two cinemas, many restaurants of different style, bars and some dancefloors.
Once in the year in January and February the whole region is celebrating carnival, the local name is "Fasenacht" or "Fastnacht". It is mostly a tradition of catholic areas. The local names come from a period named "Fastenzeit" (a time of fasting) some weeks before Easter, when one should do fasting. The celebrations are always ending on Tuesday midnight and the fasting period starts on the following Wednesday, named "Aschermittwoch".
In autumn every village has a extra weekend to celebrate. It is the memorial to the opening of their church. The feasts are named "Kirchweih" or - in the local dialect - "Kerb". In former times great autumn fairs were held on that weekend and the people, especially the young ones of the nearby places, went to the feasts to meet each other in the village, to have pleasure, to dance together and make friends.
During late spring and summer many small feasts are celebrated on weekend, mostly in the forests at the barbecue places. They are arranged by the local clubs and associations, even by the local political parties. They are open to the public and people go there to socialize, having a meal and drinking some beer.
The most special and expensive vegetable of the region is asparagus, which loves the poor sandy soil. It is gathered in May and June. Because of the same reason the region has a lot of potato dishes. Some of them are very special and only available on special occasions like the "Bauernkeeskuche" (farmers cheese pie). It is a sort of salty potato pie, that is made with a bread dough.
The traffic in Rodgau runs mostly individual by car. A lot of people are working in nearby cities. They have to drive to their jobs in Frankfurt, Offenbach or other big places. They use the motorway "A3" running through the north of Rodgau.
East along the city runs the B45 from north to south, a motorway-like street connecting all the urban districts with the motorway A3 and the cities of Offenbach, Frankfurt and Hanau to the north and Darmstadt to the south. The suburban railway no. 1 (German: "S-Bahn-Linie 1") runs to Offenbach and, since 2003 directly to Frankfurt. A poor bus system (a single line) connects the urban districts frequently. Rodgau can be easyly reached by street from most other parts of Germany. This was one reason for its fast development in the past.
The city has no own daily newspaper. There are the "Offenbach-Post" and the "Frankfurter Rundschau", both with additional pages (supplement) about Rodgau. The Offenbach-Post supplement is named "Rodgau-Post". It comes weekly on Thursday. There are two weekly papers for free which are brought to every house: The "Rodgau-Zeitung" and the "Bürgerblatt". The "Dreieich-Spiegel" also comes to the houses for free and has a part with Rodgau things. There is a quarterly city magazine "mein rodgau", with articles about people, sports, culture and life style.
Radio information comes by the radio station "Hessischer Rundfunk" ("HR") on channel 1 to 4, "You FM" and "hr-info". Other radio stations are "Hit Radio FFH", also "Radio Primavera" in the nearby bavarian city of Aschaffenburg.
Rodgau does not have a hospital. The next clinic is about 7 km away in Seligenstadt. The town is short with specialist doctors. Patients often have to go to nearby cities, if they want to see a doctor on special diseases, for example a heart disease. There is a medical emergency center in Dudenhofen to give fast help in case of a heart attack.
The city has many kindergartens and primary schools in each urban district. There is a secondary school (highschool) in Dudenhofen. For colleges and universities the students have to go to the nearby cities.

Charles Michael "Chuck" Palahniuk (born February 21, 1962) is an American satire author. He is well known for writing the award-winning book "Fight Club". It was later made into a movie directed by David Fincher. He lives in the state of Washington.
Palahniuk was born in Pasaco, Washington and raised in Burbank, Washington and Eastern Washington. started writing books when he was in his mid-thirties. His first book, "Insomnia: If You Lived Here, You'd Be Home Already", was never made into a book because he didn't think the story was very good. When he tried to write his next novel, "Invisible Monsters", publishers did not like it because they thought it was too scary. This made him work on his best known book, "Fight Club". He wrote it to try to scare the publisher even more for not publishing his book. Palahniuk wrote this story in his spare time. After first writing it as a short story, Palahniuk made it longer into a full book, which, surprising to him, was published.
In 1999, a changed version of "Invisible Monsters", and his fourth novel, "Survivor", were published. This made Palahniuk a cult figure. A few years later Palahniuk wrote his first New York Times bestseller, "Choke". After that, Palahniuk's later books would mostly have the same success. This success allowed him to travel and promote his books, where he reads from new and upcoming books.
Palahniuk is openly gay and a lapsed Catholic.

<doc id="222393" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=222393" title="Order of St Michael and St George">
Order of St Michael and St George

The Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George is an order of chivalry. It was started on 28 April 1818 by George, Prince Regent, who became King George IV of the United Kingdom. It started when he was Prince Regent for his father, King George III.
It is named in honour of two military saints, Saint Michael and Saint George.
The Order has three classes, listed below from highest to lowest:
It is used to honour people who have done important things for the Commonwealth or foreign nations.
People are "appointed" to the Order rather than given it. British Ambassadors to foreign nations are often appointed as KCMGs or CMGs. For example, the British Ambassador to the United States, Sir David Manning, was appointed a CMG when he worked for the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO).
After his appointment as British Ambassador to the United States, he was promoted to a Knight Commander (KCMG). Often, when the Queen visits a nation, the British ambassador to that nation automatically becomes a Knight Commander of the Order, and afterwards they may use the title "Sir", before their name.
It is the normal award for members of the FCO.
The Order's motto is "Auspicium melioris ævi" (Latin for "Token of a better age"). Its patron saints are Saint Michael the Archangel and Saint George. One of its primary symbols is that of St Michael standing over Satan.
The Order is the sixth-most important in the British honours system, after The Most Noble Order of the Garter (the highest British honour), The Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle, The Most Illustrious Order of St Patrick, The Most Honourable Order of the Bath, and The Most Exalted Order of the Star of India.
The Most Illustrious Order of St Patrick (for Ireland) has not been appointed since 1934 as the Republic of Ireland is no longer part of the United Kingdom. The Most Exalted Order of the Star of India has not been used since India's independence in 1947.
The Order was started to remember the British protectorate over the Ionian Islands. The Islands had come under British control in 1814. It was given its own constitution as the United States of the Ionian Islands, in 1817.
The order was to reward people, who lived on their Ionian Islands and on Malta, who worked for the King.
The protectorate ended in 1864, and the Ionian Islands became a part of Greece.
The reasons for being appointed to the Order were changed in 1868. Anyone who did important work in Queen Victoria's government (especially overseas) could be appointed. After this change, many Governors-General and Governors were appointed to the Order.
The British Sovereign is the Sovereign of the Order and appoints all other members of the Order. The sovereign follow the advice of the Government.
After the sovereign, the next-most senior member is the Grand Master. The office used to be held by the Lord High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands, but now they are chosen by the Sovereign.
Grand Masters include:
The number of members originally in the Order included:
Members of the Royal Family who are appointed to the Order are not counted as part of these limits and neither are foreigners appointed as "honorary members" (this means that they cannot use the title 'Sir' or 'Dame', and do not receive all the privileges of the order)
The Order has six officers:
The Order's King of Arms is not a member of the College of Arms.
The Usher of the Order is known as the Gentleman Usher of the Blue Rod. He does not perform any duties related to the House of Lords, unlike the Usher of the Order of the Garter (the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod).
Members of the Order wear decorated costumes on important occasions (such as coronations), which vary by rank:
The Sovereign will name some days "collar days". On these days, members attending formal events may wear the Order's collar over their military uniform or evening wear. When collars are worn (either on collar days or on formal occasions such as coronations), the badge is hung from the collar.
All collars which have been awarded since 1948 must be returned to the Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood. The other symbols can be kept..
The original home of the Order was the Palace of St Michael and St George in Corfu This was the home of the Lord High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands. It was also the location of the Ionian Senate meetings.
Since 1906, the Order's chapel has been in St Paul's Cathedral in London. (The Cathedral also serves as home to the chapels of The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire and The Imperial Society of Knights Bachelor.) Religious services for the whole Order are held every four years. New Knights and Dames Grand Cross are 'installed' at these services (this means that they are officially appointed and make an oath of loyalty to the Sovereign).
The Sovereign and the Knights and Dames Grand Cross have stalls in the choir's area of the chapel.
Over their stall, their heraldic devices are displayed: The Knight's helm, decorated with a mantling (cloth tied to the helpmet) and topped by his crest (often an animal).
Under English heraldic law, women who are not monarchs do not bear helms or crests - this is because in the past, women did not fight in wars or tournaments, so they did not have a helmet. Instead of a helmet, Dames will have a coronet (a small crown). The exact design will depend on how important the Dame's is in society.
Above the crest or coronet hangs the Knight or Dame's heraldic banner, showing the coat of arms. At the back of the stall there is a piece of brass (a "stall plate") displaying its occupant's name, arms and date of admission into the Order. Upon the death of a Knight, the banner, helm, mantling and crest are taken down. The stall plates are not removed, but remain permanently placed somewhere in the stall, so that the stalls of the chapel are covered with a colourful record of the Order's Knights and Dames Grand Cross since 1906.
The reredos (decorated panels) within the chapel were designed by Henry Poole, in 1927.
Members of the Order of St Michael are given positions in the order of precedence (the order in which members of the nobility should be placed in a procession or other events). Wives of male members are also given positions in the order of precedence. So are sons, daughters and daughters-in-law of Knights Grand Cross and Knights Commanders. Relatives of female members are not given any special precedence.
Knights Grand Cross and Knights Commanders use the title "Sir" before their given name, and Dames Grand Cross and Dames Commanders use "Dame". For example, John Smith and Jane Doe would be called "Sir John Smith" and "Dame Jane Doe".
Wives of Knights may use the title "Lady" before their surname (for example "Lady Smith"), but husbands of Dames have no title.
These titles are not used by peers and princes, except when the names of peers are written out in their fullest forms. Honorary members (usually members from other countries) and clergymen do not receive the accolade or use the title.
Knights and Dames Grand Cross use the post-nominal "GCMG". Knights Commanders and Dames Commanders use "KCMG" and "DCMG" respectively. Companions use "CMG". Examples are:
Knights and Dames Grand Cross are also allowed to receive heraldic supporters (figures on either side of the shield, which look like they are holding it up). These may be real or imaginary animals, or human figures. They may also surround their arms with the design of the circlet (a circle bearing the motto) and the collar. The circlet is shown either outside or on top of the collar.
Knights and Dames Commanders and Companions may display the circlet (but not the collar) around their arms. The badge is depicted hanging from the collar or circlet.
In the satirical British television programme, "Yes Minister", Jim Hacker MP is told an old joke by his Private Secretary, Bernard Woolley, about what the different post-nominals mean.
Ian Fleming's spy, James Bond, was appointed to the CMG, in 1953 (mentioned in the novel "From Russia, with Love"). He was offered the KCMG in "The Man with the Golden Gun", but he would not take it, as he did not wish to become a public figure.

Gilbert Thomas Carter

Sir Gilbert Thomas Carter KCMG (Greenwich, Kent, 14 January 1848 – Barbados, 18 January 1927) was an administrative officer in the Royal Navy and later a colonial official for the British Empire.
Starting as a Collector of Customs for the Gold Coast, he later became the Treasurer of the Gold Coast and The Gambia. Changing his career to administration, he started as the Administrator for The Gambia, where he dealt with the aggression of the native King of Gambia. He then became Governor for the Lagos where he negotiated on treaties with the local chiefs which protected Christian missionaries and ending human sacrifices. He later served as the Governors for The Bahamas and Barbados and finally as the Governor for Trinidad and Tobago.
Carter was the only son of Thomas Gilbert Carter who was a Commander in the Royal Navy. He was educated at the Royal Naval School in Greenwich.
Carter joined the Royal Navy in 1864, working as an Assistant Clerk on different ships. He also worked as a Clerk and as an Assistant Paymaster (the person responsible for paying everyone). His final job in the Royal Navy was on a Colonial steamer. While he was on this ship, he took part in the third war between England and the Ashanti people on the Gold Coast (now Ghana). 
When the town of Elmina was sold to the British by the Dutch Government, he was a commissioner, responsible for valuing the military supplies left behind by the Dutch. He left the Navy on 21 July 1875.
In 1875, Carter became the private secretary to Sir George Berkeley who was the Governor of the Leeward Islands. In August 1879, he became Collector of Customs and Treasurer of the Gold Coast.
From 1882 until December 1888, Carter was in charge of the "Settlement" (the British colony) on The Gambia as a Treasurer and Postmaster. From 1886, he was acting Administrator of the Colony of the Gambia, until 1 December 1888, when he was given the job as full Administrator on the Gambia's separation from Sierra Leone.
On 1 January 1890, Carter was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG).
In 1891, the native King of Gambia had been organising abusive acts towards the British colonists. Carter sent an envoy from his official residence in Bathurst with a message that if the abuses continued, "he might expect a visit of a disciplinary nature from the marine forces of the Queen of England." (This means that the British Navy would send warships to punish the King.) The King sent the envoy back mutilated, with a message: "This is the King's answer." In response, Carter sent three British gunboats to get revenge for the bad treatment shown to the envoy.
On 3 February 1891, Carter became Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Colony of Lagos (now Nigeria). In 1892, Carter ordered an attack on the Ijebu tribe (of the Yoruba people) "in the interest of civilisation". Afterwards, he continued to say that this attack was a war to end slavery and promote civilisation. In early 1893, Carter travelled to various parts of Yorubaland, travelling with soldiers, in an attempt to show the power of the British. Some of the tribal chiefs did not want Carter there, and told him not to interfere with the slavery trade.
In January 1893, the Egba chiefs decided to sign a Treaty of Independence with the British Government. The Crown agreed that Her Majesty's Government would not try to take over any part of the Egba Nation without the permission of the lawful Authority of the nation. They also agreed that no aggressive actions should be made against the nation, and that its independence would be recognised. The Egba chiefs also said they would end human sacrifices.
He became a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) on 3 June 1893. This was for the work that he did in Yoruba country, and for bringing an end to a long war there.
Carter sent works of art made by the Ife peoples of Yoruba to Europe.
In 1898, Carter was moved to The Bahamas as the Governor and Commander-in-Chief. He also had a temporary job as the Governor of Trinidad and Tobago. In July 1904, he was moved to Barbados as Governor and Commander-in-Chief.
In the spring of 1903, Carter met Gertrude Codman Parker (born 6 February 1875). She was travelling in the Bahamas with her parents. Carter and Parker got married on 25 August 1903 in the Church of the Advent in Boston, USA. He had been married before this, and had three sons and two daughters. His son Humphrey was Director of the Cambridge University Botanic Garden.
Carter retired in 1910. In 1919, he changed his surname to "Gilbert-Carter" and in the early 1920s, he moved back to Barbados, and lived at Ilaro Court, which had been designed and built by his wife. 
He died in Barbados on 18 January 1927.

Uvula

The uvula is the punchbag-shaped object on the back of a throat, in the middle of the soft palate. Massaging the uvula causes the gag reflex which makes someone vomit.
The uvula functions with the back of the throat, the palate, and air coming up from the lungs to create a number variety of different sounds. Consonants involving sound from the uvula are not found in most dialects of English, though they are found in many Semitic, Caucasian, and Turkic languages, as well as several languages of Western Europe such as German, French and a few Celtic languages, where it is used to make a sound called the uvular trill.

Blood diamond

A blood diamond, also known as a conflict diamond, is a diamond that came from an area which is controlled by armed groups which oppose the rules and regulations of governments. These diamonds are mined by civilians who have been ordered by the armed groups to do so (most of them are children), and typically if they refuse to do the work they may be possibly raped, abused, or even murdered. The diamonds are then sold and used to buy weapons to help the armed groups fight against the government. Because of this, most of the blood diamond mining happens in war zones. This is a form of exploitation. There have been 3.7 million deaths over diamonds.

<doc id="222432" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=222432" title="Solomon's Temple">
Solomon's Temple

According to the Hebrew Bible, Solomon’s Temple, was the first temple the Israelites built for God. It was also called the first temple and was first built by Solomon. It stood next to the king’s palace, and was both God’s royal palace and Israel’s center of worship. The Bible says that the Lord said to Solomon, “I have consecrated (made special or clean) this temple…by putting my Name there forever. My eyes and my heart will always be there” (1 King 9:3). A symbol of holiness and royalty, it reminded the Israelites that God was the special head of Israel. It was patterned after the tabernacle and, in general, other temples at that time, and was divided into three important areas: the Most Holy Place, the Holy Place and the outer courtyard. It was built in Jerusalem, on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite, where Solomon's father David had bought to build an altar to God.
According to secular Historians, the Temple would have been completed in around 960 BCE. The Babylonians destroyed it in 587 or 586 BCE. Rabbinic literature says that the temple stood for 410 years. According to the work Seder Olam Rabbah, written in the second century CE, the temple was built in 832 BCE, and destroyed in 433 BCE (3338 AM). This is 165 later than the secular estimates.
To date, no definite archaeological proofs for Solomon's Temple have been found and the only information regarding the First Temple in Jerusalem is inside the biblical books of Joshua, Judges, 1-2 Samuel and 1-2 Kings.
At first, King David wanted to build a temple for God, but according to the Bible, God said to him through the prophet Nathan, "You are not to build a house for my Name, because you are a warrior and have shed blood." However, he chose Solomon to build the temple. Before his death, David gave his son Solomon the plans for the building of the temple, and instructions for the priests and Levites, and all the work of serving in the temple. He also gave his own money to Solomon to help build the temple, and asked the people to help give gifts of money.
King Solomon sent a message to Hiram king of Tyre, who had been friends with his father David and sent David lots of wood to build his palace with. In this message, Solomon said that he wanted to build a temple for the Lord, and asked Hiram to send him wood. Hiram said that he would if Solomon gave food for the cost of the wood and work people did. So Hiram gave Solomon all the cedar and pine logs he wanted, and Solomon gave Hiram wheat for his family, and twenty thousand baths (about 115,000 gallons or 434 000 liters) of olive oil. King Hiram cut down the wood and sent them on to a place called Joppa. From there they could take the wood up to Jerusalem.
According to the Bible, “In the 480th year after the Israelites had come out of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in…the second month, he began to build the temple of the LORD.”(1 Kings 6:1) King Solomon brought Huram-Abi, whose mother was a widow from the tribe of Naphtali (one of the tribes of Israel) and whose father was a man from Tyre and a person who was a craftsman in bronze. Huram was very good at all kinds of work. In 2 Chronicles 2:7 it says that he was "...skilled to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, and in purple, crimson, and blue yarn." He was especially good at working with bronze. When all the work King Solomon had done for the temple was finished, he brought in the things his father David had given to God, and put them in the treasuries of the temple. So "In the eleventh year in the month of Bul, the eighth month, the temple was finished in all its details according to its specifications." (1 Kings 6:38 NIV)
When the temple was finished, King Solomon brought the of the Lord's covenant to the temple and made all the people of Israel come there, and they sacrificed so many sheep and cattle "they could not be recorded or counted". Then the cloud filled the temple - just as God showed himself on the at Mt. Sinai, he now showed himself at the temple in a cloud. Then King Solomon praised God. He said a prayer of dedication (giving to God) in front of the people of Israel. He asked God to keep his promise to King David of letting King David's sons rule forever (which, according to the bible, becomes true when Jesus, the son of David, dies for mankind); then he added, "But will God really dwell on earth? The heavens, even the highest heaven, cannot contain you. How much less this temple I have built!"—reminding the people that God was not bound to the temple and could not be contained, even though he had chosen to come and with the people of Israel in a special way. Then he asked God to answer the people of Israel when they prayed toward, or at, the temple; to hear from heaven when someone sinned, or enemies came to Israel, or there was drought or famine in the land, "...whatever disaster or disease may come, and when a prayer or plea (asking for something, request) is made by any of your people Israel...then hear from heaven, your dwelling place. Forgive and act; deal with each man according to all he does, since you know his heart (for you alone know the hearts of all men), so that they will fear you all the time they live in the land you gave our fathers" (1 Kings 8:38-40). Then Solom stood up and blessed the people of Israel, and gave sacrifices to God: "twenty thousand cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep and goats. So the king and all the Israelites dedicated the temple of the LORD"(1 Kings 8: 63, NIV).
According to the Bible, when Solomon had finished building the temple, God appeared to him and said, "I have heard the prayer and plea you have made before me...My eyes and my heart will always be there [at the temple you have made]." However, God also warned to Solomon the importance of obeying God's covenant (promise) in order to enjoy its blessings, not its curses. This was needed because God gave Solomon power and wealth, which many times made people forget the promise God had made with them.
Solomon also gave to Hiram king of Tyre 20 towns in Galilee because Hiram had given him all the cedar and pine and gold he had needed. But Hiram did not like the towns Solomon had given him and he said, "What kind of towns are these you have given me, my brother?" (1 Kings 9:13, NIV) He called them the Land of Cabul (which sounds like the Hebrew for "good-for-nothing"). Probably Solomon had become more indebted to Hiram than he had at first thought, so he had given the towns to Hiram king of Tyre as a sign that he would pay him later. 2 Chronicles 8:1-2 says that later, when Solomon became richer - maybe because of the expedition to Ophir (1 King 9:26-28;10-11) or the visit from the queen of Sheba.
The temple of Solomon was next to the king's palace. The floor plan was like most West Semite kinds of floor plans. An early example of a floor divided into "ulam", "hekal", and "debir" (, main hall, and inner ) has been found at Syrian Ebla (c.2300 B.C.) and much later but more around the time of Solomon, at Tell Tainat at the Orontes basin (c.900 B.C.). Like Solomon's, the later temple has three divisions has two columns at the entrance (in Solomon's palace, they are called "Jakin" and Boaz"), and is next to the royal palace.
The ark of the covenant of God was put inside the inner sanctuary - the Most Holy Place - which was about 30 feet (about 9 meters) long, wide and high, overlaid with pure gold. Solomon used lots of gold in the temple: this was probably because the bright gold symbolized the glory of God and his heavenly temple (Rev.21:10-11,18,21). Inside the temple were carved , palm trees and flowers. This is a reminder of the Garden of Eden, which humans could not live in anymore because of their sin. The temple was a symbol that the Israelites could come back to paradise through the temple.
Some discoveries today echo the words in 1 Kings 6-7.
Something very much like the wheeled movable basin used in the courtyard of the temple has come from archaeological on Cyprus.
A stone altar having four horns on the corners was found at Megiddo. It shows a good idea of how the gold altar in the temple looked like. The table for the Bread of the Presence was also made of gold. The Bread of the Presence (twelve pieces of bread, one for every tribe of Israel), symbolized a continual offering to God by which Israel showed that she gave to God what she earned with her work, and that everything Israel had received was a blessing of God's.
Ten lamp stands were in the temple, five on each side of the (1 Kings 7:49). Lamps like these have been found in many places in Palestine, including Hazor and Dothan.

<doc id="222534" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=222534" title="Nucleosome">
Nucleosome

Nucleosomes are the building blocks which make up chromosomes. They consist of a segment of DNA wound around a histone protein core.
First, DNA and a protein make up chromatin. Then the chromatin is packed up into nucleosomes. Nucleosomes are then packaged up to make a chromosome. The packages do three things: the chromosomes function in cell division; the very long DNA is wrapped up in a shorter package; and the proteins regulate the gene action in cells.
Nucleosomes form the basic repeating units of eukaryotic chromatin. This packs the large eukaryotic genomes into the nucleus and allows it to be controlled.
In mammalian cells about two metres of linear DNA have to be packed into a nucleus of roughly 10 µm diameter. Nucleosomes are folded, in a series of higher order structures, to form a chromosome. This folding compacts the DNA and adds a layer of regulatory control. The control ensures correct gene expression. 
Nucleosomes are thought to carry epigenetically inherited information, as modifications of their core histones. This information can be passed on to daughter cells, but it usually wiped out by meiosis in germ cells.
The nucleosome hypothesis proposed by Don and Ada Olins and Roger Kornberg 
in 1974, was a big step for understanding eukaryotic gene expression. Kornberg won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry (2006) for this and other discoveries.
Although the nucleosome is a very stable protein-DNA complex, it is not static. It undergoes some structural re-arrangements, such as nucleosome sliding and DNA site exposure. Nucleosomes can inhibit or facilitate transcription. 
Since they were discovered in the mid 1960’s, histone changes were thought to affect transcription.
Some modifications have been shown to be correlated with gene silencing, others seem to be correlated with gene activation. The information stored in this way is considered epigenetic: it is not coded in the DNA but is nevertheless inherited by daughter cells. The maintenance of a particular state of a gene is often necessary for cellular differentiation.

Extremophile

An extremophile is an "organism" (a living thing) which lives best in extreme conditions that are harmful to most life on Earth. They are different from organisms that live in normal places, called "mesophiles" or "neutrophiles".
In the 1980s and 1990s, biologists found that microbes can survive in extreme environments. These are niches that are extreme in some way. They may be extremely hot, or cold, or dry, or under huge pressure, or very salty or acidic. Complex orgamisms, such as animals or plants, cannot live in these environments. 
Some scientists suggest that life may have begun on Earth in hydrothermal vents far below the ocean surface. Environments such as hot oceans, hot springs and deep ocean hydrothermal vents would have been common during the Archaean eon, about 3.9 billion years ago. Early forms of life lived in those conditions.
Most known extremophiles are microbes. The domain Archaea has well-known examples of extremophiles, but some bacteria are also extremophiles. It is a mistake to use the term extremophile for all archaeans, since some of them are mesophilic. Not all extremophiles are unicellular: some extreme environments have animals which are multicellular. 
Some extremophiles fall under several categories. For example, organisms living inside hot rocks deep under Earth's surface are both "thermophilic" and "barophilic".

Meowth

Meowth has a cat-like design, with cream-colored fur, and has brown paws and tail tip. It has whiskers, black-and-brown ears, and a gold coin on its head. Meowth is spends most of the daytime sleeping and walks the city streets at night. They put their claws back into their paws so they can move without noise and not leave footprints. Meowth loves round objects, as well as shiny things. The item it loves collecting the most are coins since they are both round "and" shiny. Meowth collects them and keeps them in its nest. Murkrow, a bird Pokémon, also likes coins and steals them from Meowth.
Meowth appears as a wild Pokémon in many versions of the games. Meowth is one of the characters in the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games. Meowth is also seen in the Nintendo 64 game Pokémon Snap, the Nintendo GameCube game "Pokémon Channel", and many others. Meowth is seen in the Super Smash Bros. series as a Pokémon used with a Poké Ball item, and uses its move "Pay Day" and throws coins at players.
Meowth has made an appearance in almost every episode in the anime because one is owned by Team Rocket agents Jessie and James, the show's main antagonists. He first lived in the city, and tried to impress a female Meowth named Meowzie by learning to walk on two legs and speak human language. Instead of being impressed, she told him he was a freak, so Meowth joined Team Rocket. Meowth was cloned in "", but his clone could not talk or walk on two legs, because Meowth needed to learn how to do this. The Meowth clone is shown again in "". A trainer named Tyson owns a Meowth, which beat Ash's Pikachu a the Hoenn Pokémon League. This Meowth was dressed up like Puss in Boots.
In the Pokémon Adventures manga, Meowth's first appearance is a cameo in the first chapter as one of the Pokémon that escapes from Professor Oak's Laboratory. Meowth has appeared in the Pokémon Trading Card Game first in the Jungle series. A special Meowth card was given when buying the Pokémon Trading Card Video Game. In an open forum interview with ABC News, Pokémon anime director Masakazu Kubo noted Meowth as his favorite Pokémon, saying that while not a major Pokémon in the games, a Meowth is in the anime.
Team Rocket's Meowth ranked fourth on Game Daily's top 10 list of Nintendo characters that deserve their own games, describing him as "adorable" and explaining that his intelligence and ability to speak gave writers more depth than other Pokémon would. IGN stated that without the anime, the character would not have been as famous, further describing it as "probably the funniest part of the show". However, another editor stated it was also popular amongst people who have never seen the anime due to being a feline. IGN also said that Meowth would make a good choice as a playable character in "Super Smash Bros. Brawl" "if Brawl's developers really wanted much more representation for Pokémon as a franchise" also stating "it would be fun to face him in battle as a real fighter, just to be able to send him "blasting off again," referencing Team Rocket's Meowth GamesRadar described Meowth as "not all that useful", and questioned if the Pokémon would have stood out if it were not for its portrayal in the anime.

When Alabama became a state in 1819, the state got the design as the official state seal. The seal has a map showing one of the state's most valuable resources—its major rivers. Bibb's design served as the official seal until 1868, when it was replaced by a design having on it an eagle holding in its beak a banner that read "Here We Rest." The legislature and Governor Frank M. Dixon restored Bibb's original design in 1939, and it has remained unchanged since.

Modular origami

Modular origami (also called unit origami) is a type of paperfolding that uses many sheets of paper. Modular origami is used to make large structures that cannot be made with one sheet of paper. Many sheets of paper are folded in identical shapes, and they are then put together by inserting flaps into pockets. 
The first modular origami model comes from a 1734 Japanese book by Hayato Ohoka called "Ranma Zushiki". The book has pictures of many traditional origami models, and one is a modular cube called "tamatebako". "Tamatebako" is a Japanese word meaning "magic treasure box", and it is called this because the box can be opened on any side. Another traditional model, kusudamas, are balls of folded paper flowers. They are often hung as decorations using string or thread.
The various number of modules is combined from two to tens of thousands modules. When modules are put together, most are supported only by the friction of paper, also they are glued together or sewn by threads.
Mitsunobu Sonobe designed in 1970s. It is so simple that most people can make kusudamas. Module of Sonobe method is one of the most famous modules. We can make a polyhedron like a cube or a trisoctahedron(a dodecahedron?) by putting together many modules.
Modular Rate is the facility of putting together. This rate is how many people can put together without joining materials like glues. This rate applies the model that was designed so that it was put together without using joining materials from the beginning.

Fiddler crab

A fiddler crab, also called a calling crab, is a land crab that lives in mud or sand flats near the beach. The reason this crab is called a fiddler crab is because it holds its large in front of its body and moves it back and forth as if it is playing a fiddle.
The male fiddler crab has one huge cheliped and another smaller cheliped. Sometimes it's the right cheliped that's the big one and sometimes it's the left. If a male loses its large cheliped, the smaller one will grow large to replace it. This huge cheliped is so large that it is sometimes bigger than the whole crab. It is this cheliped they wave back and forth.
The fiddler crab eats by first opening its mouth, then using its maxillipeds (a part of its mouth), it scoops in a small amount of mud or sand, depending on where it lives. Then, it uses its other mouthparts to scrape any food matter (algae, decaying animals or plants)it can from the dirt it has just put into its mouth. After this, it forms the mud or sand into a little , which is called a "feeding pellet". It then drops the feeding pellet and starts all over again.
etter than the ones they usually build. The crabs guard these burrows . Where there are lots of fiddler crabs, there are usually hundreds of these little burrows all lined up only a few inches apart. Each male fiddler crab stands out in front of his burrow waiting for the females to return from eating. The females then walk around looking at the different burrows. As they walk past, the males wave their big chelipeds back and forth. If a female likes a male or burrow, she will stop and stare. Then the male begins waving his cheliped wildly. Sometimes the female will run away. However, if she stays, the male will run between her and the burrow, back and forth, again and again. If she has still not run away, she will come closer to the burrow. Then the male will enter the burrow a little and start drumming against the side of the tunnel with his cheliped. If the female likes what she hears, she will go down into the burrow, and they will mate.

Night or nighttime is the time when the Sun is not in the sky. Night happens after dusk and before dawn. The opposite of night is day. The start and end times of night are different in different geographic locations. It varies on season, latitude, longitude and timezone.
In other time zones, the night occurs at different times. This is because the Sun shines on different parts of the Earth at different times. During a solar eclipse it is also partially night because the Sun is blocked out by the Moon.
In popular culture, night is often thought of as a symbol of evil, possibly because of the fear of the dark or possibly because of the lack of visibility.

Barnyard (movie)

Barnyard is an animated movie which first shown in theaters on August 4, 2006. It was directed by Steve Oedekerk.
Otis is a cow who likes to play. His father Ben is the leader of the barnyard when the farmer is away. Otis interrupts a barnyard meeting with his wild behavior, His father tells Otis he will never be happy if he just goofs off, and that he should grow up. Otis ignores his advice and leaves to have fun with his friends: Pip the mouse, Pig the pig, Freddy the ferret, and Peck the chicken. That same day, Otis meets a new cow, Daisy, who is pregnant. She is with Bessy, another female cow. 
That night the animals have a party in the barn. All the animals are there except Ben, who is guarding the animals. Otis is supposed to be working with him, but he wants to be at the party. Ben talks with Otis and says the day he found him alone in the meadow, the stars danced. Otis is given permission to go to the party and he runs to the barn. 
Later on, Ben has to fight a pack of coyotes led by Dag. They are raiding the chicken coop. Ben is bitten in the leg by a coyote, and he falls down. The coyotes pile on Ben, but he manages to grab Dag and escapes the pile. The hens cheer, but Ben falls on the ground, tired. Etta, a hen, runs into the barn and tells Otis, who runs outside to his father. Ben opens his mouth as if to say something, but dies. 
After Ben's death, all the animals elect Otis as the new leader of the Barnyard. He gets out of his duties by leaving Freddy and Peck in charge of the coop. Later, Otis is sitting with Daisy and he overhears the coyotes chasing a hare. Otis tries to attack Dag but is outsmarted. Since Otis is weaker, Dag makes a deal that he and his pack will take some of the animals, but if he tries to stand up for all of them, they will kill everyone. Otis decides to leave the barnyard because he has no chance against the coyotes.
The next morning, before leaving, Otis finds out that the coyotes have taken some hens and a chick. Otis knows that he has been tricked by Dag, as he was not expecting them until tonight. He goes to rescue the poultry. Otis confronts the pack but is easily defeated. Pip, Pig, Freddy, Peck and Miles the Mule arrive to help them, along with the gophers and Jersey Cows. Dag tries to sneak attack Otis from behind, but Otis is alerted when Peck successfully yells a warning. Otis catches Dag and tells the coyote to never return. Dag is swung out of the junkyard by Otis's golf skills.
Otis and the rest make it back to the barnyard. Daisy gives birth to a calf whom she names Ben. Duke, the farmer's sheepdog, asks Otis if he wants to stay and be their leader. Otis agrees, and everyone cheers as he walks outside. Once again, he sees the stars dancing.

Robert J. Lang

Robert J. Lang (born May 4, 1961) is an American physicist known for his contributions to the art of origami.
Lang started his career in origami forty years ago, and many think he is now one of the world's best paperfolders. He travels often, giving lectures about how origami is related to other topics, like science, mathematics, and technology. Lang is also the author of nine books, and has written articles in several origami magazines. He has found many uses of origami in real life situations, like airbag design and an expandable space telescope. 
Before being a professional origamist, Lang had many different jobs. He was a physicist, engineer, and research and development manager in chemistry. Lang has helped to write 80 publications, and has over 50 patents.
Lang was born on May 4th, 1961 in Dayton, Ohio, but he grew up outside Atlanta, Georgia. He was first introduced to origami when he was six years old. Lang was very good at math and math class bored him, so his teacher gave him an origami book to keep him entertained. He quickly folded the models in the book, and then folded models in many other books. In his early teens, Lang began folding his own models, and he drew diagrams on how to make them.
Lang went to college at Caltech, The California Institute of Technology, where he learned electrical engineering. He found college very hard, and often folded origami as a distraction from college life. Lang was afraid to tell people about his hobby, and he was even "a little embarrassed about it." For a long time, Lang didn't know any other origamists. He graduated from Caltech with a Ph.D. in physics, and later he graduated from Stanford University with a master's degree in electrical engineering.
While in college, Lang noticed the name and address of the Origami Center of America, and he soon became friends with other experienced paperfolders, including Michael LaFosse, John Montroll, Joseph Wu, and Paul Jackson. They inspired Lang with their pretty and complex models, and he soon created new models; he designed a hermit crab, an ant, a skunk, and many other others. Soon afterwards, he took a trip to Germany, where he was fascinated by their beautiful cuckoo clocks. They inspired him to make origami clocks, which impressed many paperfolders. Soon after completing his first origami clock, Lang began a job at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
In 2000, Lang decided to quit his job and begin a career in origami.
In 2011, Lang discussed his work in an interview with Peter Shea at the University of Minnesota. 
Lang has written nine books about origami:

Lent

Lent, in the Christian tradition, is a period of about six weeks before Easter. It is a time in which Christians are supposed to be quiet and thoughtful, preparing themselves for Easter. They should pray a lot, give money to charities and give up some of the things they might otherwise do for pleasure. The period of Lent ends at Easter, which is a time of great celebration as the Christians think of how Jesus had died on the cross but then rose again from the dead.
Lent is traditionally supposed to be forty days long. That is because the Bible says that Jesus spent forty days in the wilderness, preparing for his death and resurrection.
Lent begins on Ash Wednesday. In the Catholic Church, it ends at the Ninth Hour of Maundy Thursday (44 days). In The Anglican Catholic Church, it ends on Holy Saturday (46 days).
Churches in the Byzantine tradition (for example, Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic) count the days of Lent differently. There are also different local traditions in the Oriental Orthodox church.
Lent is traditionally a time for fasting (not eating much). This tradition was useful because it was a time when food which had been kept for the winter had to be eaten up before it went bad. Many Roman Catholics do not eat meat other than fish on Fridays during Lent.
The word "lent" came from the Old English "lencten" meaning "spring" (the season).

Jennifer Government: NationStates

NationStates is an browser game where you run your own country. It was made by an Australian man called Max Barry and the idea for it was from his book "Jennifer Government". It came out on 13 November 2002. There was a sequel, NationStates 2, but it is now closed.
In the beginning, you create your own country. On the first page, you choose your name, flag, motto, money and government type. On the next page, the answers decide the first rankings of your nation. At first, a country has a population of 5 million and rises every day.
Issues are the most important part of the game. In it, you have to choose an option to solve a problem in your country. Also, you can just click "dismiss" to ignore it. None are the right one, as each one has it's downsides. After the 30 original issues, Max Barry realized that more were needed so he gave players with a population of over 500 million an option to send him their own issue ideas.
The way you choose the solutions to the issues changes your civil rights, political freedoms and economy rankings. The names of the rankings can be seen below:
Based on these, each country is placed in one of 27 types, such as Inoffensive Centrist Democracy, Scandinavian Liberal Paradise and Corporate Police State.

2010 Haiti earthquake

The 2010 Haiti earthquake was a very strong earthquake that hit Haiti on January 12, 2010. On the scientific scale that measures the magnitude (or strength) of an earthquake, the quake scored a magnitude of 7.0 M. The center of the earthquake was near Léogâne, very close to Port-au-Prince, the capital and largest city of Haiti. It was only about west. The earthquake hit in the afternoon, at 16:53:10 local time (21:53:10 UTC). Haiti already was the poorest country in the western hemisphere, and was not able to take care of all the people that needed help. 
About three million people were affected by the earthquake, many homes were destroyed. Three days after the earthquake, the Haitian Interior Minister said that up to 200,000 had died because of the quake and its effects. This was many more deaths than officials originally thought. At first, the Red Cross had guessed a much smaller death toll of 45,000–50,000.
The earthquake caused major damage to Port-au-Prince. Most major landmarks were badly damaged or destroyed. The Presidential Palace, the National Assembly building, the Port-au-Prince Cathedral, and the city's main jails were all destroyed. The president at the time, René Préval, survived. 
Most hospitals in the area were destroyed, which made things much worse. The headquarters of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) in Port-au-Prince collapsed. The Mission's Chief (Hédi Annabi), his deputy, and the acting police commissioner were killed in the quake. Elisabeth Byrs of the United Nations (UN) called the earthquake the worst disaster the United Nations had ever had. This was not just because of the property damage and deaths from the earthquake. The roads, phone lines and government buildings of the UN in Haiti and the Haitian government were also destroyed, so trying to just get organized and get help to the people was a real problem. So many people died in such a short time, that they used dump trucks to haul the dead bodies to mass graves.
 After the earthquake, many charities and organizations asked people around the world to help Haiti. The International Red Cross, the Salvation Army, the United Nations, and president René Préval all asked the world for help. Raymond Joseph, Haiti's ambassador to the United States, and his nephew, famous singer Wyclef Jean, also begged people to give money. (A few years before the earthquake, President Preval had asked Jean to become a "roving ambassador" for Haiti.)
Many different countries started raising money and sent medical teams or search and rescue teams to Haiti. The Dominican Republic, which is next to Haiti, was the first country to give aid. This helped reduce some bad feelings between the two countries that had been there a long time.
But it takes a long time to rebuild a city and the area around it. Just finding places to move all the broken parts of buildings was difficult. And countries promise money to help rebuild, but it takes a while to get the money, and in most disasters, only half the money that is promised is actually sent. (This doesn't count millions of dollars that people gave directly). For years many people were living in tents, wherever they could find room. And workers for the UN introduced cholera to the country in October 2010, which made many people sick and killed thousands more. The country is still recovering.

Rödermark is in the "Rhine Main area" 35 km southeast of Frankfurt. The whole area of the town is 29.99 km large and it is 142 m above sea level. It is a plain area with nearly no hills.
About 35 to 20 million years ago in the age of tertiary the whole region was lying under sea level. At that time it was covered by an ocean which was warm and not very deep. Lots of sediments sank to its bottom. Then the region rose again and the water left, leaving soil which is mostly sandy and poor.
The town consists out of the 2 former independent villages "Ober-Roden" and "Urberach". On 1 January 1977 they were united and became the "municipality of Rödermark". On 23 August 1980 the town privileges were given to the municipality.
The city has 5 urban districts. These are "Ober-Roden", "Urberach", "Waldacker", "Messenhausen" and "Buhlau".
The ending "-roden" is a hint to the former landscape. The German verb "roden" means "cutting down trees to cultivate land".
The neighbours of Rödermark are: 
Rödermark has 27,858 inhabitants (2008). 10.7% of the people living here are from foreign countries.
The climate of the town is mild. There is less rain than in other parts of Germany.
Some local people are speaking a regional type (dialect) of the German language with a certain tone and special words. It is a Hessian dialect (German: "Hessisch"). This language type is related to other dialects in the south of Germany. In former times mostly every village had its own special dialect, sometimes hard to understand for people of other parts of Germany. Today the dialect speakers are a minority and mostly it is no longer the dialect they speak but a kind of regular German with a certain pronunciation.
The first settlements were build in the 8th century. At that time their names were written down in documents.
Formerly the people in the Rödermark area were farmers and craftsmen but not tradesmen. Every family had land to grow their food. When the property was handed to the next generation it was divided within the children. Therefore most families had only small farms and were poor. With the industrial revolution the Rhine Main area got lots of factories and developed to a center for metal working and leather manufacturing, also chemical processing. Many men got workmen and found a job in the factories and earned money. This increased living conditions partly.

Saint Catherine of Alexandria, also known as Saint Catherine of the Wheel and The Great Martyr Saint Catherine (Greek "") is a Christian saint and martyr. She is believed to have been a well-known scholar in the 4th century. In the 15th century it was claimed she had spoken to Joan of Arc. The Orthodox Church venerates her as a "great martyr", and in the Catholic Church she is traditionally revered as one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers.
Catherine was the daughter of Costus, a pagan governor of Alexandria. She announced to her parents that she would only marry someone who was more beautiful, intelligent and rich than herself. In addition, that person needed to have a better social status than she had. Eventually, she discovered Christ. "His beauty was more radiant than the shining of the sun, His wisdom governed all creation, His riches were spread throughout all the world."
She was a martyr, because she died for her beliefs in God. According to legend, she was supposed to die on a breaking wheel, but the wheel broke as soon as she touched it, so her head was cut off instead. Because of this, her main symbol is the spiked wheel, which is known as a Catherine wheel. The Catholic Church of St. Catherine, one of the first Catholic churches built in Russia, was named after her.

Seed plants are the gymnosperms and angiosperms. Their seeds have three parts: (1) an embryo, (2) a supply of nutrients for the embryo, and (3) a seed coat. They are also called spermatophytes or phanerogams. The seed plants dominate almost all the environments on land.
The living spermatophytes form five groups: 
The fossil seed ferns (Pteridospermatophyta) were one of the earliest successful groups of land plants, and forests dominated by seed ferns were prevalent in the Permian. "Glossopteris" was the most prominent tree genus in the ancient southern supercontinent of Gondwana during the Permian period. By the Triassic period, seed ferns had declined, (perhaps were extinct) and modern gymnosperm groups were abundant and dominant to the Upper Cretaceous, when angiosperms radiated.

Octet rule

The Octet rule is a general rule of thumb that applies to most atoms. Basically, it states that every atom wants to have eight valence electrons in its outermost electron shell. 
According to the Bohr model, an atom consists of a nucleus of protons and neutrons orbited by a number of electrons. In an ordinary atom, the number of electrons equals the number of protons. If it has more or fewer electrons, it is an ion. In addition, the electrons orbit in electron shells. Each shell can only contain a certain number of electrons before new electrons must migrate to the next shell or "energy level." Starting with the third energy level, however, electrons sometimes move up a level even before the current one is full. 
Every atom tries to have 8 electrons in its outermost (or valence) shell. This may require them to give up, share, or take electrons. As stated above, the number of electrons normally equals the number of protons. This means that some atoms are "happier" than others. For example, neon, as with other noble gases naturally has 8 valence electrons. (10 total - 2 in the 1st energy level=8 in the 2nd) Not surprisingly, neon hardly ever reacts with anything. (Neon lights require high voltages to work.) By contrast, the atoms in the Alkaline metals column, such as sodium, have one valence electron, with a layer containing 8 electrons in the shell below. That means that if sodium only has to give up that one electron in order to complete the octet rule, and does so if given the chance. This is why sodium is so chemically reactive.

When the property was handed to the next generation it was divided within the children. Therefore most families had only small farms and were poor. With the industrial revolution the Rhine Main area got lots of factories and developed to a center for metal working and leather manufacturing, also chemical processing. Many men got workmen and found a job in the factories and earned money. This increased living conditions partly.

Pichilemu

The beach of Pichilemu is called one of the best beaches in the world for surfing. The most famous beach in Pichilemu is Punta de Lobos, where competitions are commonly made. The city has become a beach resort.
Promoucaes were the first people that populated Pichilemu. They were hunter gatherers and fishermen. 
In 1887, President José Manuel Balmaceda decreed Pichilemu as a minor dock.
José Toribio Medina did his first archeological investigations in Pichilemu, and he published in 1908 "Los Restos Indígenas de Pichilemu". He said there that Pedro de Valdivia gave land in what is now central Chile to Juan Gómez de Almagro on February 24, 1544. Pichilemu was between the areas of the Palloquierbico, Topocalma, and Gulaquien.
The name Pichilemu comes from the Mapudungún words ' (little) and ' (forest).
Some of the first land owners of Pichilemu were the Ortúzar family. Daniel Ortúzar is known as one of the founders of the original village of Pichilemu. The family of Ortúzar Cuevas, from the San Antonio de Petrel Hacienda, made a mid-century maritime dock which was as a fishing port for some years. They also built homes along the dock on what is now Ortúzar Avenue. More recently, other large land owners are Pedro Pavez Polanco and the Hacienda of San Antonio de Petrel. In 1891, during the Chilean Civil War, Daniel Ortúzar and the priest of Alcones were taken prisoners from Pichilemu through the dock. During the war, the dock was burned down. After the civil war, Pichilemu got its formal name and status. President Jorge Montt and his Minister, Manuel José Irarrázabal, the city was officially established on December 22, 1891.
Pichilemu has become the historic capital of the province called Cardenal Caro which is named for the first Chilean Catholic Church Cardinal. His father was the first mayor in the city.
Agustín Ross Edwards was a Chilean writer, Member of Parliament, minister and politician.
Ross was very rich and based on his European background, he bought a 300-hectare piece of land and named it ""La Posada"" (), or Petren Fund, in 1885. Ross designed an urban place of high environmental value and landscape, turning ""La Posada"" into a hotel ("Great Hotel Pichilemu", later "Hotel Ross", or "Ross Hotel"), and building a casino, embankments, stone walls, a balcony facing the beach. Additionally, he built a park and a forest of more than 10 hectares. Agustín Ross turned Pichilemu into a summer resort town for the people from Santiago. Some of his buildings were named National Monuments.
Pichilemu is located west of San Fernando, Chile and just east of the Pacific Ocean. It is around a three-hour drive to the Andes Mountains. It is also near the coastal mountain range.
Even though most of the forest areas around Pichilemu are covered in Pine and Eucalyptus trees, a native forest (now Municipal Forest) is still there It contains species such as Litres, Quillayes, Boldos, Espinos and Peumos.
Pichilemu borders Litueche to the north, Paredones to the south, Marchigüe and Pumanque to the east, and the Pacific Ocean to the west .
In the 17th century, Pichilemu had 1,468 inhabitants. In 1787, Pichilemu had 1,688 inhabitants. In 1907, Pichilemu had 7,787 inhabitants. However, the city's population progressively decreased; in 1920, it was 7,424; in 1930, it was 6,929, and in 1940, it was 6,570. In 1952, the city's population increased to 7,150 inhabitants; in 1992, that figure had increased to 10,510. As of the 2002 census, 12,392 people live in the town. The census recorded that 9,459 people (76.3%) are from urban places of the city, and 2,933 people (23.7%) are from rural places of the city, there are 6,440 (52.0%) men and 5,952 (48.0%) women. The area of Pichilemu is . According to the CASEN 2002 census, 544 inhabitants (4.4%) of the population of Pichilemu live in extreme poverty compared to the average in the greater Region of O'Higgins of 4.5%, and 1,946 inhabitants (15.7%) live in mild poverty, compared to the regional average of 16.1%.
Pichilemu, along with the communes of Placilla, Nancagua, Chépica, Santa Cruz, Pumanque, Palmilla, Peralillo, Navidad, Lolol, Litueche, La Estrella, Chile, Marchihue and Paredones, is part of the Electoral District N° 35 and belongs to the 9th Senatorial Constituency (O'Higgins) of the electoral division of Chile.
The current Mayor of Pichilemu is Roberto Córdova. The last popularly-elected mayor was Marcelo Cabrera, elected in 2008 with 42.08% of the vote, who served from May 2009 to August 2009 due to legal action. The municipal council selected Córdova as the new mayor on September 9, 2009, almost a year after the municipal elections. The current councilors are Aldo Polanco Contreras, Andrea Aranda Escudero, Viviana Parraguez Ulloa, Juan Cornejo Vargas and Marta Urzúa Púa.
Surfing is one of the tourist attractions, particularly at Punta de Lobos. According to travel guide Fodor's,
Every October and December the International Championship of Surf takes place at La Puntilla Beach. Punta de Lobos hosts the "Campeonato Nacional de Surf" () each summer.
Pichilemu has many dark sand beaches. The water is cool year-round, though many tourists choose to swim during the summer months. Bodyboarding, surfing, windsurfing, and kitesurfing can be practiced.
The beach that is farthest north is San Antonio Beach or Main Beach (), which is found in front of the Ross Park. It is known for good surfing.
Las Terrazas Beach () is the busiest beach during the summer. Many surf schools, "La Ola Perfecta" and "Lobos del Pacífico", are found near the beach, as is the Caleta de Pescadores (), where fisherman sell their fish. found at the south of the town and around the other side of the Puntilla, the Infiernillo Beach is found. It is used for fishing. At the south of Infiernillo, Playa Hermosa is found, which is great for walking and fishing.
Further south, from Pichilemu, Punta de Lobos is found .It is an increasingly popular destination for tourists and specially for surfers. Several surf contests are held there, including an international big-wave contest during the Chilean fall. The size of waves varies throughout the year, but large swells in fall and winter can reach heights of up to 50 feet (15 metres). It is widely considered one of the best beaches for surfing worldwide.

Queen of Sheba

The Queen of Sheba ruled over the ancient kingdom of Sheba, and is mentioned in the Bible and the Qur'an.
The Queen of Sheba appears in the Bible to King Solomon, because of the fame of his riches and wealth and wisdom. She comes, "with a very great caravan - with camels carrying spices, large quantities of gold, and precious stones - she came to Solomon and talked with him about all that she had on her mind" (1 Kings 10:2).
Solomon answered all the questions she asked; returned her quizzes and riddles with wit and correct wisdom; and was kind to her. Awed and astonished by all these things, she rewarded his achievements with "120 talents of gold, large quantities of spices, and precious stones. Never again were so many spices brought in as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon" (1 Kings 10:10), and Solomon returned it by giving "all she desired and asked for, besides what he had given her out of his royal bounty" (1 Kings 10:13).

Babenhausen

Babenhausen is a town in the Darmstadt-Dieburg Rural District in the state of Hesse, Germany.
Babenhausen is in the "Rhine-Main area" 35 km south east of Frankfurt. The whole area of the town is 66,87 km large and it is 127 m above sea level. It is a plain area with no hills.
About 35 to 20 million years ago in the age of tertiary the whole region was lying under sea level. At that time it was covered by an ocean which was warm and not very deep. Lots of sediments sank to its bottom. Then the region rose again and the water left, leaving soil which is mostly sandy and poor.
The city consists out of the town "Babenhausen" and the 5 former independent villages "Hergershausen", "Harpertshausen", "Harreshausen", "Sickenhofen" and "Langstadt".
The neighbours of Babenhausen are: 
Babenhausen has 16,066 inhabitants (2008).
The climate of the town is mild. There is less rain than in other parts of Germany.
Some local people are speaking a regional type (dialect) of the German language with a certain tone and special words. It is a Hessian dialect (German: "Hessisch") spoken in the south of Hesse. This language type is related to other dialects in the south of Germany. In former times mostly every place had its own special dialect, sometimes hard to understand for people of other parts of Germany. Today the dialect speakers are a minority and the majority of them does not speak the real dialect. They rather speak a kind of regular German with a certain pronunciation.
Babenhausen and the former villages are early places where people lived. In the time of the 7th to the 9th century new places to live got name endings like "-hausen" and -"stadt". But the names of the places were not written down.
In 1236 the name of Babenhausen was written down in a document for the first time. About 50 years later it got the town privileges (1295). During the Thirty Years' War the military made a lot of damages to the city. Many people died because of diseases and hunger (Bubonic plague).
Formerly the people in the Babenhausen area were mostly farmers and craftsmen but not tradesmen. Every family had land to grow their food. When the property was handed to the next generation it was divided within the children. Therefore, most families had only small farms and were poor. With the industrial revolution the Rhine-Main area got lots of factories and developed to a center for metal working, leather manufacturing and chemical processing. Many men became workmen and found a job in the factories and earned money. This increased living conditions partly.
In World War II Babenhausen was a central place for Russian soldiers, who where caught in the fights with the German. They lived here as war prisoners and had to work for the German people. After World War II it became a central place for Jewish people that were prisoners of the NAZI concentration camps.

Alamosaurus

Alamosaurus was a titanosaur, a gigantic plant-eating dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous period, about 73 million to 65 million years ago. 
"Alamosaurus" was a long-necked, whip-tailed dinosaur. It was about 69 feet (21 m) long and weighed perhaps 33 tons (30000 kg). Fossils have been found in New Mexico, Texas, and Utah. Fossils include fragmentary skeletons (and no skulls).
Skeletal elements of "Alamosaurus" are among the most common Late Cretaceous dinosaur fossils found in the United States Southwest and are now used to define the fauna of that time and place. There was a climate change in this area, it became drier, and this caused changes in the fauna. Thomas M. Lehman describes it as "the abrupt reemergence of a fauna with a superficially 'Jurassic' aspect". These faunas are dominated by "Alamosaurus" and feature abundant "Quetzalcoatlus" in Texas. The "Alamosaurus" "Quetzalcoatlus" association probably represent semi-arid inland plains.

Iron

Iron (Fe) is the second most common metal on Earth, and the most widely-used metal. It is element 26, a transition metal in Group 8. Its symbol is Fe, from the Latin word for iron, "ferrum". Its atomic number is 26 and its mass number is 55.85.
It is used a lot because it is very strong and cheap. Iron is the main ingredient used to make steel. Raw iron is attracted to magnets, but it is not actually a magnet, however it can be used to make an electromagnet.
Iron is a grey, silvery metal. It is magnetic. It is easy to mine and make, which is why it is so useful. Pure iron is soft and very malleable and is able to stretch a lot, while steel (iron mixed with a little carbon) is stronger and does not stretch as much as iron.
Iron is reactive. It reacts with most acids like sulfuric acid. It makes ferrous sulfate when reacted with sulfuric acid. This reaction with sulfuric acid is used to clean metal.
Iron reacts with air and water to make rust. When the rust flakes off, more iron is exposed allowing more iron to rust. Eventually, the whole piece of iron is rusted away. Other metals like aluminum do not rust away. Iron can be alloyed with chromium and carbon to make stainless steel, which does not rust under most conditions.
Iron powder can react with sulfur to make iron(II) sulfide, a hard black solid. Iron also reacts with the halogens to make iron(III) halides, like iron(III) chloride. Iron reacts with the hydrohalic acids to make iron(II) halides like iron(II) chloride.
Iron makes chemical compounds with other elements. Normally the other element oxidizes iron. Sometimes two electrons are taken and sometimes three. Compounds where iron has two electrons taken are called ferrous compounds. Compounds where iron has three electrons taken are called ferric compounds. Ferrous compounds have iron in its +2 oxidation state. Ferric compounds have iron in its +3 oxidation state. Iron compounds can be black, brown, yellow, green, or purple.
Ferrous compounds are weak reducing agents. Many of them are green or blue. The most common ferrous compound is ferrous sulfate.
Ferric compounds are oxidizing agents. Many of them are brown. The most common ferric compound is ferric oxide, the same thing as rust. One reason why iron rusts is because ferric oxide is an oxidizing agent. It oxidizes iron, rusting it even under paint. That is why if there is a small scratch in the paint, the whole thing can rust.
Compounds in the +2 oxidation state are weak reducing agents. They are normally light colored. They react with oxygen in air. They are also known as ferrous compounds.
These compounds are rare; only one is common. They are found in the ground.
Compounds in the +3 oxidation state are normally brown. They are oxidizing agents. The are corrosive. They are also known as ferric compounds.
Iron metal is thought to be the main ingredient in the Earth's core but it is almost never found in native form on or near the surface. Some meteorites contain iron in the form of rare minerals. Normally iron is found as hematite ore in the ground, much of which was made in the Great Oxygenation Event. Iron can be extracted from the ore in a blast furnace. Some iron is found as magnetite.
Iron is present in meat. Iron is also found in hemoglobin in red blood cells.
Iron is made in large factories called "ironworks" by reducing hematite with carbon (coke). This happens in large containers called blast furnaces. The blast furnace is filled with iron ore, coke and limestone. A very hot blast of air is blown in, where it causes the coke to burn. The extreme heat makes the carbon react with iron ore, taking off the oxygen from iron oxides, and making carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is a gas and it leaves the mix. There is some sand in with the iron. The limestone, which is made of calcium carbonate, turns into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide when the limestone is very hot. The calcium oxide reacts with the sand to make a liquid called a slag. The slag is drained, leaving only the iron. The reaction will leave pure liquid iron in the blast furnace, where it can be shaped and hardened after cooling down. Almost all ironworks are today part of steel mills, and almost all iron is made into steel.
There are many ways to work iron. Iron can be hardened by heating a piece of metal and splashing it into cold water. It can be softened by heating it and allowing it to slowly cool. It can also be stamped by a heavy press. It can be pulled into wires. It can be rolled to make sheet metal.
In the United States, much of the iron was taken from the ground in Minnesota and then sent by ship to Indiana and Michigan where it was made into steel.
Iron is used more than any other metal. It is strong and cheap. It is used to make buildings, bridges, nails, screws, pipes, girders, and towers.
Iron is not very reactive, so it is both easy and cheap to extract from ores. It is very strong once made into steel, and is used to reinforce concrete.
There are different types of iron. Cast iron is iron made by the way described above in the article. It is hard and brittle. It is used to make things like storm drain covers, manhole covers, and engine blocks (the main part of an engine).
Steel is the most common form of iron. Steels come in several forms. Mild steel is steel with a low percentage of carbon. It is soft and easily bent, but it does not crack easily. It is used for nails and wires. Carbon steel is harder but more brittle. It is used in tools. 
There are other types of steel. Stainless steel because of the chromium content is rust resistant, and nickel-iron alloys can remain strong at high temperatures. Other steels can be very hard, depending on the alloys added.
Wrought iron is easily shaped and used to make fences and chains.
Very pure iron is soft, and can rust(oxidize) easily. It is also fairly reactive.
Iron compounds are used for several things. Iron(II) chloride is used to make water clean. Iron(III) chloride is also used. Iron(II) sulfate is used to reduce chromates in cement. Some iron compounds are used in vitamins.
Our bodies need iron to help oxygen get to our muscles, because it is at the heart of some essential macromolecules in our bodies such as hemoglobin that cause it to work better. Many cereals have some added iron (the element "metal" iron). It is added to cereal in the form of tiny metal filings. It is even possible to see the slivers sometimes by taking an extremely strong magnet and putting it into the box. The magnet will attract these pieces of iron. Eating these small metal shavings are not harmful to our body.
Iron is most available to the body when added to amino acids – iron in this form is ten to fifteen times more digestible than than it is as an element. Iron is also found in meat, for example steak. Iron provided by diet supplements is in the form of a chemical, such as Iron(II) sulfate, which is cheap and is absorbed well. The body will not take up more iron than it needs, and it usually needs very little. The iron in red blood cells is recycled by a system which breaks down old cells. Loss of blood by injury or parasite infection may be more serious.
Iron is toxic when large amounts are swallowed. It can damage the body. When too many vitamins that have iron in them are eaten, people get sick. There are chemicals that doctors have that can react with iron and stop it from poisoning people.

<doc id="223084" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=223084" title="Age of the Earth">
Age of the Earth

The age of the Earth is estimated at a little over 4.5 billion years. Working this out was a difficult problem to solve. For most of human history, the basic facts about the planet were unknown. The problem was tackled by Earth scientists in the twentieth century.
Modern estimates are based on radioactive dating methods. The oldest minerals on Earth – small crystals of zircon from the Jack Hills of Western Australia – are at least 4.4 billion years old. Ca-Al-rich inclusions – the oldest known solid bits in meteorites formed within the solar system – are 4.567 billion years old. This gives an age for the solar system and an upper limit for the age of Earth.
The first facts about the Earth were worked out by the Ancient Greeks. A good estimate of the Earth's size was made by Eratosthenes (276 –194 ), using trigonometry. The first estimate of the Earth's age based on evidence was by Benoît de Maillet (1656–1738), a French diplomat, philosopher and naturalist. He thought the Earth must have developed by slow, natural forces. He studied geology in the field. He could see signs of erosion on land and sedimentation in the sea. He hid his ideas under the guise of a talk with an Indian philosopher, to avoid conflict with the Catholic Church. His work stayed in manuscript until after his death, when it was published after its editor had made changes which damaged it. Now there is a better modern edition based on the manuscripts. de Maillet estimated that the Earth was older than two billion years. He also recognized the true nature of fossils, and had early ideas about evolution.
In the last quarter of the 19th century there was a long-running debate on the age of the Earth. In Charles Lyell's "Principles of Geology" (1830–33), he showed that the Earth had changed slowly, and that what we see is the result of gradual changes. This clearly meant that the Earth was ancient, though Lyell did not try to work out how old. His younger friend Charles Darwin believed this, too. Darwin saw that if evolution had taken place, it would have required a long time. Also, a huge amount of sedimentary rock lies between the early fossils in the Cambrian strata, and the present land surface. Darwin and Lyell agreed that it would have taken a very long time for so much rock to be deposited.
In the first edition of "On the origin of species" (1859), Darwin had estimated that the erosion of the Sussex Weald must have taken 300 million years. Both he and Lyell were surprised when the physicist William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) said the Earth could not be as old as they thought. He made the calculation based on how long it must have taken the Earth to cool down to its present temperature, given a starting point of 2,000C. Kelvin's result was based on the idea that the near-surface geothermal gradient reflects the conductive cooling of the solid Earth.
He did this calculation a number of times, making various assumptions. In 1862 his estimate was between 20 and 400 million years; but in 1866 he reduced the top estimate to 100 million years, and attacked Darwin and Lyle for not taking notice of his calculation. We know Darwin was anxious and worried that this would not be long enough to allow for evolution. Thomas Henry Huxley remarked that Kelvin's calculations were good, but his assumptions were wrong. In 1897 Kelvin did the calculation one last time, and came up with 20 to 40 million years. This, of course, would definitely not be long enough to allow for evolution.
Right at the end of the 19th century, someone realised that if the mantle was a highly viscous (sticky) fluid, that would make a great difference to the calculations. In 1895, John Perry, a former assistant to Kelvin, produced an age of Earth estimate of 2 to 3 billion years old using a model of a convective mantle and thin crust.
In Kelvin’s model, heat on the Earth’s surface
is derived from the cooling of a shallow outer crust, assuming a solid Earth. But if the conductivity inside the Earth were much higher than at the surface, then the Earth's core and lower mantle would also cool. This would provide a huge store of energy to the surface. In that case, Kelvin’s estimate of the age of the Earth would be too low by many times.
Perry's main reason was that convection in the fluid, or partly fluid, interior of the Earth
would transfer heat much more effectively than would conduction:
Kelvin stuck by his estimate of 100 million years, and later reduced the estimate to about 20 million years.
We now know that the existence of a viscous fluid under a thin crust is a much greater factor than the discovery of radioactivity, which was the textbook explanation for many years. The rediscovery and reexamination of Perry's work is quite recent.
In 1896 discovered radioactivity. In 1903, he shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with Pierre and Marie Curie "in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by his discovery of spontaneous radioactivity".
Eventually, it was realized that radioactivity was a major source of heat inside the Earth. In 1921 came the first modern estimate, using radiometric dating. It was based on uranium-lead dating: the rate of decay of uranium to lead in the crust of the Earth, by Henry Norris Russell. He came up with 2 to 8 billion years. In 1949, H.E. Suess estimated 4 to 5 billion years, based on a whole array of radioactive isotopes. This is close to the time we estimate today, which has been refined further to about 4,560 million years.
The calculation makes use of convection in a viscous fluid as well as radioactivity, so it combines Perry's idea with the effect of radioactivity, even though Perry's contribution had been forgotten. The later knowledge of plate tectonics made it quite certain that the lower mantle was a viscous fluid.
The formation and evolution of the Solar System is estimated to have begun 4.568 billion years ago with the gravitational collapse of a small part of a giant molecular cloud. Basically, the whole system developed in the same period of time.
Many societies assumed the Earth had always been as it is now. Some religions raised the question of its age: the Hindu religion got closest to the present-day scientific estimate. Some Christians and Jews believe the Genesis creation narrative is literally true, which would mean that the Earth was created between 5000 and 10,000 years ago. However, these days most people think such questions are best answered by scientific methods.

Angara (rocket family)

Angara is a family of rockets which are being developed in Russia. The family contains many different rockets. For example, there is a rocket for lifting small payloads and a rocket for lifting heavy payloads. The rockets are designed by a company called Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center. The first rocket is expected to be ready in 2012.
Angara is being developed using money given by the Russian government. The government decided to finance Angara because they wanted to make sure that Russia has independent access to space. Many of Russia's current rockets can only be launched from Baikonour Cosmodrome in Kazakshtan. Many of them also use foreign technology. However, Angara is better since it does not use any foreign technology (it is 100% Russian) and can be launched from Plesetsk Cosmodrome, located in Russian territory. Another reason why it was decided to build Angara is because Russia needed a rocket which does not use toxic fuels, like some current rockets do.
The first part of all Angara rockets consists of an engine called Universal Rocket Module (in short: URM). The small version, Angara 1.1 has only one URM, while the heavier Angara 5 has 5 URMs. For this reason, Angara 5 can lift heavier payloads. The second part (called the second stage) of Angara 1.1 is called Briz-KM and the second stage of Angara 5 is called Block I. 
The rockets are meant for launching unmanned payloads such as satellites. However, Khrunichev has also suggested building a version that could launch humans into space: Angara 5P. 
All Angara versions can be launched from a single launch pad. 
The first flight of Angara is expected to take place in 2012 from Plesetsk Cosmodrome. In the future, the flights on Angara rockets will be sold to other companies, who want to get their satellites into space. The price for an Angara 1.1 flight is expected to be about 20 million dollars.

Samsara

Samsara is a Buddhist term, meaning the conditioned state of mind. It is the cycle of ignorance, leading to disturbing emotions and clumsy actions. They in turn are cause for suffering and new disturbing feelings and so on. According to Buddha’s teachings there are three main disturbing feelings: ignorance, anger and desire. They are called three poisons of mind and are told to have 84 000 combinations. The only way to completely get rid of suffering is to reach Nirvana or the perfect state of Buddha. All the teachings Buddha gives lead to this goal. 
There are six realms of samsara, connected to six specific emotions:

Elijah

Elijah of Tishbe is a person in the Abrahamic religions. His name means "Yahweh is God," was a prophet in Israel in the 9th century BC. He appears in the Hebrew Bible, Baha'i scripture, Mishnah, New Testament, and the Qur'an. He is best known for being Israel's most famous prophet, his brave challenge to Baal's prophets on Mt. Carmel, and going up to heaven in a whirlwind.
Elijah went to the king, Ahab, who rejected God because of his even more sinful wife, Jezebel of Tyre, who stood as a symbol of Israel's unfaithfulness. He went to Ahab and God said through his lips (1 Kings chapter 17, NIV), "As the Lord, the God of Israel lives, whom I serve, there will be neither dew nor rain in the next few years except at my word."
Then Elijah followed the Lord's command and "went eastward and hid in the Kerith Ravine, east of the Jordan."
He "drank from the brook, and God had ordered ravens to feed him there". 
The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the brook (because it did not rain, as he prophesied).
But then the brook dried up because of so little rain, and Elijah received the message from the Lord: "Go at once to Zarephath of Sidon and stay there. I have commanded a widow in the place to supply you with food" (1 Kings 17:9). 
So Elijah went, and met the widow gathering sticks to make the last meal for her son and herself. 
But when he called her and requested her to get himself some jar in a water and bread, she objected, (1 Kings 17:12) "As surely as the Lord your God lives, I don't have any bread - only a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug. I am gathering a few sticks to take home and make a meal for myself and my son, that we may eat it - and die." 
Then Elijah said to the widow, "Don't be afraid. Go home and do as you have said. But first make a small cake of bread for me from what you have and bring it to me, and then make something for yourself and your son. For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel says: 'The jar of flour will not be used up nd the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the Lord gives rain on the land.'" So the widow did as Elijah told her to do, and there was enough food in the widow's house for everybody.
But then the son of the widow grew ill. He finally, after growing more and more worse, stopped breathing. 
The widow became so very worried, and called Elijah--"What do you have against me, man of God? Did you come to remind me of my sin and kill my son?" 
And Elijah replied, "Give me your son." He took him and carried him to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him on his bed. Then he cried out to the Lord, "O Lord my God, have you brought tragedy also upon this widow I am staying with, by causing her son to die?" Then he stretched himself upon the boy three times (probably to give to the boy his body warmth, though his prayer shows that he expected the life of the child to come back as an answer to prayer, not by physical touch), and cried out to the Lord, "O Lord my God, let this boy's life return to him!"
And the boy returned to life, making the woman admit that Elijah is "a man of God and that the word of the Lord from your mouth is the truth": a confession the Lord's own people Israel had not made. This is the first example of raising the dead in the Bible.
Then Elijah went to "present himself to Ahab" as the Lord commanded him to, and he met Obadiah, the honorable man who had kept loyal to the Lord and had hidden 100 priests of God that King Ahab had tried to kill. Obadiah recognized Elijah and respectfully bowed down to the ground, exclaiming, "Is it really you, my lord Elijah?" 
Elijah replied yes, and ordered him to go and tell Ahab that he is here. Obadiah refused, crying, "What have I done you wrong that you are handing your servant over to Ahab to be put to death?" and declaring how he had "hid a hundred of the Lord's prophets in two caves, fifty in each, and supplied them with food and water." and that if Ahab came and saw that Elijah was gone and not here, he would surely kill him.
Elijah replied, the more the calmly, "As the Lord Almighty lives, whom I serve, I will surely present myself to Ahab today."
So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him, and Ahab went to meet Elijah. They argued, and Elijah told Ahab to "summon the people from all over Israel" to meet him on the Mount Carmel, and to "bring the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel's table". And surprisingly, Ahab obeyed him.
Then, when all the Israelis and prophets of Baal were summoned, they prepared two altars - one for Elijah, and for the Lord the God of Israel - and one for the priests of Baal. Then Elijah went to the people and said, "How long will you waver between two opinions? If the Lord is God, follow him; but if Baal is God, follow him." but the people did nor say anything, so he continued: "I am the only one of the Lord's prophets left, but Baal has four hundred and fifty prophets. Get two bulls for us. Let them choose one for themselves, and let them cut it into pieces and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. I will prepare the other bull and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the Lord. The god who answers by fire--he is the God." (1 Kings 18:20)
The people agreed to this, and they did as Elijah said. Then the priests of Baal all prepared the bull, and called to Baal all morning till noon. "O Baal, answer us!" but the so-called "Baal" made no reply at all - and the prophets grew weary and discouraged. Elijah, however, was pleased, and he teased them (1 King 18:27), "Shout louder! Surely he is a god! Perhaps he is deep in thought, or busy, or traveling. Maybe he is sleeping and must be awakened." So they shouted even louder and slashed themselves with swords and spears wildly, as was their custom, until the blood flowed from their wounds. After midday passed, it was Elijah's turn - and nobody paid attention to the Baal prophets anymore - so he prepared the sacrifice, and ordered (1 Kings 18:33), "Fill four large jars with water and pour it on the offering and on the wood."
(verse 34) And he said, "Do it again." and they did it again, and a third time, as he said.
Then, after there was so much water it ran down the trench, he stepped forward and prayed (1 Kings 18:36 to 37): "O Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, let it be known today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and have done all these things at your command. Answer me, O Lord, answer me, so these people will know that you, O Lord, are God, and that you are turning their hearts back again."
Then the fire of the Lord fell and burned up the sacrifice, the wood, the stones and the soil, and also licked up the water in the trench. All the people were awed, and they "fell prostrate" and repented. Then they all seized the prophets of Baal, as Elijah had told them to, and slaughtered them at Kishon Valley. And Ahab went off to eat and drink as Elijah told him to. Then, after climbing the mountain of Carmel and asking his servant seven times if he saw anything above the ocean, the servant answered him at the seventh time--"A cloud as small as a man's hand is rising from the sea." And Elijah told his servant to inform Ahab to go home, because a big rainstorm was coming. Ahab rushed into his chariot and raced home, but the "Power of the Lord came upon Elijah and, tucking his cloak into his belt, he ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel".
After that, Ahab told to Jezebel about what had happened about Elijah and how the prophets of Baal had been killed by the people of Israel. Jezebel got angry, and sent a message to Elijah that "by this time of the day tomorrow" she would make his "life like that of one of them", referring to the prophets of Baal. 
Elijah became scared, and ran away to Beersheba in Judah, left his servant there, and went ahead for a day's journey in the desert. Finally, he came to a broom tree, sat down under it and prayed that he might die (1 Kings 19:4). "I have had enough, Lord," he complained unhappily, "Take my life; I am no better than my ancestors." And he lay down and fell asleep. But the Lord sent an angel to wake him up and feed him some water and a cake of bread "baked over hot coals". Elijah ate and drank and lay down again, and the angel came back again and woke him, and gave him more food. Strengthened by that food, Elijah got up and traveled forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God. There he went into a cave and spent the night. 
And the Lord appeared to him and asked, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"
He replied not the answer to the Lord's question, but instead of how he had "been very zealous for the Lord God Almighty" and how the Israelites were being unfair to him. The Lord told him to go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the Lord.
Then the Lord sent a great and powerful wind, and an earthquake, a fire, but the Lord was not in neither: and finally he came in a gentle whisper, and Elijah went out, pulling his cloak over his face. The Lord had tried to show him through all those winds and earthquakes and fires that the Lord was not always harsh, but was more gentle. The Lord asked once again, "What are you doing here, Elijah?" but Elijah again ignored the question and complained about how he had been "Zealous for the Lord God Almighty". So the Lord told him to go anoint many new political and religious leaders, and he did. And he took Elisha, for his next prophet and companion.
After Ahab died, Ahaziah was crowned king, and he became ill. So he sent some people to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, to see if he would recover. However, God was very angry and told Elijah to prophesy against Ahaziah. So on the way, Elijah went and met the servants, and told them (2 Kings 1:6) as the Lord had instructed him, "Go back to the king who sent you and tell him, 'This is what the Lord says:Is it because there was no God in Israel that you are sending men to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore (Because of this) you will not leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly (surely) die!'" And the messengers did has he was told. At King Ahaziah's questions, they described Elijah as "a man with a garment of hair and with a leather belt around his waist". Elijah's cloak was probably of sheepskin or camel's hair, like John the Baptist's, and showed a big difference from the other rich, well-dressed people at that time. He was protesting against the selfishness of the king and the upper classes. The king recognized Elijah by that description (because Elijah had met Ahab, his father, many times), and sent a captain and fifty men to get him. Maybe Ahaziah thought, like many people at that time who did not believe in God, that if he killed Elijah or forced him to change the curse, it would not happen.
The captain he sent said to Elijah, who was sitting on the top of a hill, "Man of God, the king says, 'Come down!'" Ahaziah was trying to place Elijah, the prophet, under his, a king's, power. According to Israel's covenant (promise) with God, the king was supposed to be under the power of the word of the Lord spoken by his prophets.
But Elijah did not come down instead said (2 Kings 1:10, NIV) "If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men! Then fire fell from heaven and consumed the captain and his men. With this, Elijah was showing the king that in Israel, a king was only a servant of the real king, God. Later, Jesus's warning to his disciples when they were trying to call fire down to destroy the Samaritans was not to disapprove of what Elijah did, but to show his disciples that the problem between Elijah and the king and the unfaithfulness of the Samaritans was very different.
The king sent to Elijah another captain with his fifty men, and they, too, were burned up by fire. Finally, the king sent a third captain with his fifty men, who "...fell on his knees before Elijah..." and bowed before him, humbly asking him to come. Elijah was told by the angel of the Lord to go down, so he went down and told the king again, "You will certainly die!" "So he died, according to the word of the Lord that Elijah had spoken". (2 Kings 1:17, NIV)
After that, Elijah went to Elisha, and they both went on their way from Gilgal. Elijah said to Elisha, "Stay here; the Lord has sent me to Bethel." but Elijah insisted upon going, so they went down together to Bethel. 
The company of the prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha and asked, "Do you know that the Lord is going to take your master from you today?"
Elisha said that he knew; but warned them not to speak of it. Then Elijah said to him to stay there, and that the Lord had sent him to the Jordan by himself, but Elisha did not obey, and insisted on going with Elijah. Elijah then asked, "Tell me, what can I do for you before I am taken from you?" and Elisha replied: "Let me inherit a double portion of your spirit."
Elijah then agreed, but only if Elisha would see him be taken to heaven. They were walking along when suddenly a chariot of fire and horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them, and Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind. Elisha cried, "My father! My father! The chariots and horsemen of Israel!" Elisha showed Elijah as a symbol of the true strength of Israel. Elisha picked up Elijah's cloak and used it to divide the water in the river of Jordan: so this cloak symbolized that Elisha had now taken Elijah's place.

Isaac Watts

Isaac Watts (17 July 1674 – 25 November 1748) was an English pastor, preacher, poet, and hymn writer. He is often called the "Father of English Hymnody": he was the first popular English hymn writer. Because of his short height and large head, in all his portraits Isaac Watts wore a large gown. He wrote about 600 hymns including "When I Survey the Wondrous Cross", "Am I a Soldier of the Cross", and "Joy to the World". He is buried today in Bun­hill Fields Cem­etary, Lon­don, Eng­land.
Isaac Watts was born in 1674 as a small and sickly child. At this time, his father was in prison for being a nonconformist preacher. At that time in England, a man who did not preach the way the leaders of the Church of England thought about God could go to prison. Christians who were "dissenters" met secretly in fields and barns to hide from people who would report them. Dissenters were fined for preaching anywhere if five or more people were there. Isaac Watts gave much encouragement for people to continue to believe in Christ.
Isaac, even when he was young, was good at and liked rhyming. He was a good student and liked books. Once, when his mother said she would give a farthing (a coin) to one of her husband's students who could make the best rhyme, Isaac tried and made this couplet:
"I write not this for a farthing, but to try 
How I your farthing writers can outvie’."
When he was six, he made some verses. When his mother saw them, she could hardly believe he had written them. So Isaac gave his mother a poem he had made with his name:
I am a vile polluted lump of earth
S-o I've continu'd ever since my birth
A-lthough Jehovah grace does daily give me
A-ssure this monster Satan will deceive me
C-ome, therefore, Lord, from Satan's claws relieve me.
W-ash me in thy blood, O Christ
A-nd grace divine impart
T-hen search and try the corners of my heart
T-hat I in all things may be fit to do
S-ervice to thee, and sing thy praises too.
When he was in his early twenties, Isaac saw a need in the church. He told his father that the psalms sung in the church were rough and hard. Isaac's father challenged him to write better songs, and Isaac began writing hymns. Watts produced many hymns for which he is now famous.
Watts also saw that children needed to have hymns that suited their age, hymns that they could sing in their everyday life. Because of this, in 1720 he wrote "Divine and Moral Songs, for the Use of Children". These songs were about problems of youth at that time and still today, with titles like "Against Evil Company" and "Against Pride in Clothes".
Watts lived a long and full life preaching about Jesus, teaching, and writing books and hymns. When he died, his papers were given to Yale University.
Some of Isaac Watts' most well known and loved songs are:

Invasion of the Bane

"Invasion of the Bane" is the first episode of The Sarah Jane Adventures, which is a British science fiction television series about a woman called Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen). It was broadcast on 1st January 2007 and although it is written as a pilot episode, it is not. This is because a series was agreed before the pilot episode was actually written.
In this episode, a young girl called Maria Jackson discovers aliens. When she discovers that an alien race called the Bane have created a drink that can control people's minds, she decides to team up with Sarah Jane Smith, a journalist, to stop them.
This episode begins with Maria Jackson (Yasmin Paige) and her divorced father, Alan Jackson (Joseph Millson), moving into the house across the road from Sarah Jane Smith. That night, a bright, light that is coming from Sarah Jane's house wakes Maria up. Maria decides to find out what it is and find that it is an alien called a Star Poet.
The next morning, her friend and neighbour, Kelsey Hooper (Porsha Lawrence Mavour) invites her to go to the Bubble Shock open day. They hop onto the free Bubble Shock bus and get taken to the factory. When they arrive, a guard takes them to a security scanner. The scanner takes their DNA and transfers it to "the Archetype" (Thomas Knight) whilst being watched by Mrs Wormwood (Samantha Bond).
Sarah Jane has overheard the girls' plans and decides to follow them. When she is the factory she interviews Mrs Wormwood. She asks her how she gained approval of her drink so quickly and why she was not able to analyse "Bane", an ingredient only found in Bubble Shock. Mrs Wormwood simply says that Bubble Shock satisfies the needs of the Western world. She then throws Sarah Jane out. Sarah Jane is almost killed by a secretary of Mrs Wormwood.
Kelsey gets bored and walks out of the tour to phone her friend, but disturbs the Bane Mother. Mrs Wormwood tells her staff not to ring any sirens and to kill Sarah Jane Smith. When Maria tries to phone Kelsey, she sets off more alarms. These alarms cause the Archetype to escape. While Maria is escaping, she bumps into the Archetpye and takes him to the safety of the women's bathroom. He can only mimic her. Sarah Jane then finds them and helps them to escape. When they are at home, Sarah Jane warns Maria not to keep following her because her life is too dangerous.
Meanwhile, the guards at the factory are speaking to Kelsey. She complains about her treatment and to shut her up, Mrs Wormwood reveals her true, alien body. She then finds out that Kelsey and Sarah Jane live on the same street and, therefore, tells her PR (Jamie Davis) to take Kelsey home. Maria then realises that the Bane know about Sarah Jane and the PR reveals his true body as well, chasing Maria, Sarah Jane and Kelsey into Sarah Jane's house.
After stopping the PR, Sarah Jane takes the kids to her attic and tells them the truth. She tells them that aliens exist and then years ago, she met a wonderful man called "The Doctor". She travelled in Time and Space but then, the adventures stopped and she was back on Earth. She then told them that by accident, she and The Doctor met again and she then found out that he still liked her.
Sarah Jane Smith finally understands that the ingredient was sentient and rings up Mrs Wormwood and asks her to leave Earth. But Mrs Wormwood refuses and uses Bubble Shock to control the majority of the human race. Sarah Jane breaks into the factory immediately by driving the bus into the wall and the Bane Mother is revealed. She explains that she made the Archetype with different people's DNA and that the Archetype is the perfect human being. The Archetype uses the Bane technology to rescue the gang and to explode the factory.
Later on, Sarah Jane agrees to adopt the Archetype and they decide to call him "Luke" because Sarah Jane said that if she ever had a son, she would call it "Luke". The episode ends with Sarah Jane telling us that if we look hard enough, we might just find aliens.
Elisabeth Sladen played Sarah Jane Smith in Doctor Who between the years of 1973 and 1976. She played along side Jon Pertwee (The Third Doctor) and Tom Baker (The Forth Doctor). The BBC wanted her to return for some more adventures with the Fourth and Fifth Doctors but she declines. However, she agreed to star in the Special, The Five Doctors. She also agreed to star in one episode of a spin-off series K-9 and Company. She took a break from acting to raise a family but returned in the 2006 episode School Reunion starring David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor. And then she and Thomas Knight starred in the Series Four finale The Stolen Earth/Journey's End. The Sarah Jane adventures is still ongoing and it is in its third series.
On the 8th December 2008, the first scene of this episode was shown on BBC Breakfast and online, on the Doctor Who Advent Calendar. The clip showed Sarah Jane interviewing Mrs Wormwood.
When the episode was first broadcast, it received 2.9 million viewers, 15% of the audience share, of which 20% were under 16., but lost out to a showing of "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" on ITV1.

It was later found by Clyde's father. When they hold the pendant it's most common that they will have blue lines across their body.
The Blathereen are similar to the Slitheen (see below) in the fact that they are a family and not a species. The Blathereen, unlike the Slitheen, are orange and their main aim is to spread peace throughout the universe. Sarah Jane and the gang was tricked by a pair of Blathereen-Slitheen to trust them. They planted a poisonous plant around the Earth and people everywhere grew sick.
She is a red alien from an unknown species that escaped during a war between her people and the Daleks. Her Ship crashed in a seaside resort in Danemouth and Ship ordered the caretaker of a funfair to look after her until it had rebuilt.
One look at the Gorgon and you will turn to stone. That's what happened to Maria's father. They originate from the planet Gorgos.
The Groske are a different race to the Graske, they are notably blue instead of pink in skin colour. Some Groske crash-landed and were found by U.N.I.T. in 2006. Since then they have earned their keep as workmen in U.N.I.T. bases. Groske can be mistaken for Graske if you have not met them before, as Clyde, Rani and Sarah-Jane find out in Death of the Doctor, but Groske seem to have a hatred for the Graske. This two-part episode is the first appearance of the Groske.
Interstellar thug police from the planet Jadoon and resemble rhino-headed soldiers. They are hired by others to solve crimes. In Prisoner of the Judoon, one was seen chasing an Androvax. They wear a black uniform.
From the planet Griffoth, Krislok works for the Trickster and steals people from Time and Space and allows the Trickster to make them vanish from the Time Lines. Krislok was also tricked by the Trickster as his spaceship was about to crash into working for him for Eternity.
He is a member of the bug-like species Uvodni. He was a warrior for his species until he was injured and had to stop. He took control of Laser Tag centres across the world and the winning children were beamed up to a space station far above Earth to be prepared to fight in a war. Little did the General know, the war was actually over. With that, the children were returned.
The famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci came alive due to an alien organism in the paint that Leonardo used. Hidden below the art gallery is a painting so terrifying that they call it The Abomination.
Mr Smith is Sarah Jane's supercomputer that she hides in her wall. It is really a Xylock- an alien race that has a huge memory store. It first communicated with Sarah Jane's laptop when she bought the house and it promised Sarah Jane that he would help her in keeping the Earth safe for as long as he was functional. There is occasional banter between it and K-9.
The Slitheen are a family of aliens from the planet Raxacoricofallapatorius. They go around the galaxy causing trouble and their main aim in life is to make as much money as possible regardless of whom they harm in the process. In The Lost Boy, they planned to bring the moon crashing down. To defeat these green monsters, you need to throw vinegar-based products on them, as they are made of calcium and the result is a huge, gooey explosion.
Clone species from the planet Sontar. They love wars and will do anything for a fight. They complained in "Doctor Who" for not being allowed to take part in the Time War.
Star Poets are a race of fictional aliens. After Maria Jackson saw Sarah Jane Smith talking to one in "The Sarah Jane Adventures" episode called Invasion of the Bane. It was revealed that Sarah Jane was using the Star Poet for help with a poem. Sarah Jane was given a device that would bring the Star Poet back, if she ever needed its help again. Another member of the same species, with the name Mary, was seen in the "Torchwood" episode "Greeks Bearing Gifts". Torchwood showed that the race can communicate telepathically using pendants and Sarah Jane Adventures showed that they could also fly. On the official Sarah Jane Adventures website, Mr Smith stated that they were "Butterfly People"", but there have been many Torchwood references to them as being "Arcateenian". In situations like this, the continuity is left unknown.
An evil being with no eyes hidden within a veil. All he wants to do is wreak havoc. He first took Sarah Jane out of her Time Line and replaced her with Andrea Yates- something that never happened. Because of this, the end of the world nearly happened. Secondly, he tempted Sarah Jane to save her parents that she never knew before they died and she did so and the whole Earth paid the price. Without parents, she never met the Doctor and without Sarah Jane, the Doctor failed to save the Earth and it was enslaved by the Trickster. During an episode of Doctor Who, Turn Left, one of the Trickster's Brigade, a Time Beetle, latched onto Donna Noble and made her turn right instead of left. She never met the Doctor, the Doctor died and so did everyone else in the whole universe. Finally, the Trickster tricked Sarah Jane's fiancé into saving his own life and marrying Sarah Jane. Although he did love Sarah Jane, if Sarah Jane married him, she'd forget about the Earth and leave it wide open to attacks. With the help of the Doctor and the sacrifice of her fiancé, the Earth was once again safe.

Acarina

The Acarina, or Acari, are the mites and ticks. They are an order of Arachnids.
Their fossil history goes back to the Devonian era. Most acarines are tiny: less than a millimetre. It is estimated that over 50,000 species have been described, but a million or more species may be currently living. The study of mites and ticks is called acarology.
Acarines live in practically every habitat, and include aquatic (freshwater and sea water) and terrestrial species. They outnumber other arthropods in the soil and detritus. Many are parasitic, and they affect both vertebrates and invertebrates. Most parasitic forms are external parasites, while the free living forms are generally predators and may even be used to control undesirable arthropods. Others help to break down forest litter and dead organic matter such as skin cells. Others still are herbivorous and may damage crops. Damage to crops is perhaps the most costly economic effect of mites, especially by the spider mites and their relatives, earth mites, thread-footed mites and the gall and rust mites. 
Some parasitic forms affect humans and other mammals, causing damage by their feeding, and can even be vectors of diseases such as scrub typhus and rickettsia. A well-known effect of mites on humans is as an allergen which stimulates asthma. Predatory mites may be used in pest control and herbivorous mites used to attack weeds. A positive contribution of the Acari is their normal functioning in ecosystems, especially their roles in the decomposer subsystem.
A hugely successful group with a large number of species. Mites are among the most diverse and successful of all the invertebrate groups, but because of their small size (most are microscopic) go largely unnoticed. They have exploited many habitats. Many live freely in the soil or water, but there are also a large number of species that live as parasites on plants, animals, and some that feed on mould (fungi).
Ticks are blood-sucking ectoparasites, mostly of mammals and birds. They wait on grass or bushes, and jump onto passing animals. A number of birds specialise in picking them off larger animals: the Cattle Egret and the Oxpecker for example. They are quite serious pests, and can be hard to get rid of. They are vectors, carrying diseases such as Lyme disease.

Ahab

Ahab or Ach'av or Achab in Douay-Rheims (; ; ) was King of Israel and the son of Omri. He is written about in the Books of Kings and the Books of Chronicles.
Ahab son of Omri did "more evil in the eyes of the Lord than any of those before him" (1 Kings 16:30), as it is written in the Bible. Many think - and say - that it is probably because of his evil wife, Queen Jezebel, daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians. She was even more sinful than Ahab, and comes out in the Bible, commanding Ahab to do most of the things she wants. She serves the idol Baal and tries to make Ahab and all the Israelites worship it as well.
One of Ahab's most famous enemies is an old prophet (a man of God) named Elijah. He continually rebukes Ahab for being so disobeying to the Lord, and when Ahab summoned all the prophets of Baal against Elijah at Mount Carmel, and set two altars for them, Elijah won by calling on God and letting fire come and burn the sacrifice, and the prophets of Baal were immediately killed by the Israelites. Importantly, even here Ahab does nothing, either to stop or help Elijah.
Once, there was a quite well-known war between Ben-Hadad king of Aram and King Ahab. Ben-Hadad came and, "with thirty-two kings with horses and chariots" (1 Kings 20), he attacked Samaria. He said to King Ahab: 
"Your silver and gold are mine, and the best of your wives and children are mine."
This King Ahab agreed with—but after that, Ben-Hadad sent another more demanding command: "I sent to demand your silver and gold, your wives and children. But about this time tomorrow I am going to send my officials to search your palace and the houses of your officials. They will seize everything you value and carry it away."—and King Ahab grew annoyed. He rejected that command, and so Ben-Hadad decided to battle against Ahab. And after that the Lord sent a prophet and said, "Do you see this vast army? I will give it into your hand today, and then you will know that I am the Lord."
And he also added that the young officers of the commanders will do it, and that King Ahab would start the battle.
Encouraged by this, Ahab took the young officers of the commanders, 232 men. Then he assembled the rest of the Israelites, 7,000 in all. They set out at noon while Ben-Hadad and the 32 kings with him were in their tents getting drunk, and defeated them all. 
Later at spring, as a prophet prophesied to Ahab, Ben-Hadad came again, with all his army. They came to the valleys, declaring triumphantly that God was a "gods of hills" and that was why the Israelites were strong; and now that they were in the valleys, they would surely win the battle. But God wanted to prove that he was the God of everything and not only of the hills, so he helped Ahab defeat them there, too. Ahab then spared Ben-Hadad's life. This caused God to get angry at Ahab and say through a prophet (1 Kings 20:42)--"This is what the Lord says: 'You have set free a man that I had determined should die. Therefore it is your life for his life, your people for his people.'" 
Ahab also once did a great sin that the Lord was very angry at, and it included a vineyard of Naboh the Jezreelite.
He wanted a vineyard belonging to Naboth the Jezreelite, because it was in Jezreel and close to his palace. So Ahab said to Naboth (1 Kings 21:2), "Let me have your vineyard to use for a vegetable garden, since it is close to my palace. In exchange I will give you a better vineyard or, if you prefer, I will pay you whatever it is worth."
But Naboth was unwilling because "the Lord forbid" that he should give Ahab "the inheritance of his fathers". So Ahab was very angry and sulky, and when he was at home he wouldn't eat, and pouted on his bed. Then Jezebel came over and asked (1 Kings 21:5), "Why are you so sullen? Why won't you eat?" And Ahab explained to her the situation. Jezebeel told him to get up, and said that she would get him the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite. 
So she wrote some letters in Ahab's name, placed his seal on them, and sent them to the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth's city. It said:(1 Kings 21:9-10) "Proclaim a day of fasting and seat Naboth in a prominent place among the people. But seat two scoundrels opposite him and have them testify that he has cursed both God and the king. Then take him out and stone him to death." 
So the elders and nobles did as she told him to, and Naboth died a bitter, meaningless death. 
Then Jezebel declared to Ahab that Naboth was "no longer alive, but dead" and Ahab got up and took possession of Nahab's vineyard. The Lord was very angry at Ahab for this, and said to Elijah the Tishbite, a prophet--(1 Kings 21:18)"Go down to meet Ahab the king of Israel, who rules in Samaria. He is now in Naboth's vineyard, where he has gone to take possession of it. Say to him, "This is what the Lord says: 'have you not murdered a man and seized his property?' Then say to him, 'This is what the Lord says, in the place where dogs licked up Naboth's blood, dogs will lick up your blood - yes, yours!'"
King Ahab said to Elijah, when he met him (1 Kings 21:20), "So you have found me, my enemy!" 
Elijah replied, "I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do evil in the eyes of the Lord. 'I am going to bring disaster on you. I will consume your descendants and cut off from Ahab every last male in Israel - slave or free. I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat and that of Baasha son of Ahijah, becauase you have provoked me to anger and have caused Israel to sin.' And also concerning Jezebel the Lord says: 'Dogs will devour Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.' Dogs will eat those belonging to Ahab who die in the city, and the birds of the air will feed on those who die in the country." 
At hearing this, Ahab grew afraid, and humbled himself by tearing his clothes, putting on sackcloth, and fasting. He 'lay in sackcloth and went around meekly.' The Lord felt compassionate, and said to Elijah, "Have you noticed how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has humbled himself, I will not bring this disaster in his day, but I will bring it on his house in the days of his son."
According to the Bible, for three years there was no war between Aram and Israel. But in the third year, when Jehoshaphat king of Judah went down to see Ahab (who was now his father-in-law, since Jehoshaphat had married Athaliah, his daughter), Ahab said, "Let's go retake Ramoth Gilead from the king of Aram! Will you go with me?" Jehoshaphat replied, "I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses." For this, he would later be rebuked by the prophet Jehu. But he added: "First seek the counsel of the Lord."
King Ahab called together the prophets—"about four hundred men"—and asked them, "Shall I go to attack Ramoth Gilead or not?" And they said, "Go." These prophets were not really prophets, but simply did their "job" by saying things that they thought would make the king happy - not what the Lord really said. King Jehoshaphat saw that the 400 prophets were not to be trusted, and asked to see a real prophet of the Lord, saying, "Is there not a prophet of the Lord here...?" King Ahab said that there was Micaiah son of Imlah, but "...he never prophesies anything good about me, but always bad." Jehoshaphat wanted to see him, so Ahab called him. Meanwhile, Zedekiah son of Kenaanah, one of the 400 prophets, had made iron horns and he cried, "This is what the Lord says: 'With these you will gore the Arameans until they are destroyed.'" All the other prophets said the same thing. Even the messenger who had gone to call Micaiah said to him, "Let your word agree with theirs..."
When Micaiah came, he said, "Attack, and be victorious (win)." But Ahab probably saw that Micaiah was not being serious, and he said, "...tell me nothing but the truth..." So Micaiah said that he saw the Lord sitting on his throne in heaven, and that the Lord had put a "lying spirit" in the mouths of all the prophets, because they did not love the truth and had chosen to speak out of their own hearts. At this, one of the prophets, Zedekiah son of Kenaanah was so enraged he went to Micaiah and slapped him in the face, saying sarcastically, "Which way did the spirit from the Lord go when he went from me to speak (talk) to you?" (1 Kings 22:24, NIV) Micaiah replied, "You will find out...[when] you go to hide in an inner room." King Ahab put Micaiah and prison and went to battle in disguise, thinking that this way nobody would know who he was and so Micaiah's prophecy would not be fulfilled (come true). But one of the soldiers shot him by mistake, and he had a deep wound and died in his chariot, watching the battle sadly. As in the prophecy of Elijah, the dogs licked up his blood. After him, his sons succeeded as king, Ahaziah and Jehoram.

Eppertshausen

Eppertshausen is a municipality in the Darmstadt-Dieburg Rural District in the state of Hesse, Germany.
Eppertshausen is located in the "Rhine-Main area" 15 km northeast of Darmstadt. The whole area of the village is 13.11 km large and it lies 130 – 190 m above sea level. It is a plain area with a few hills.
About 35 to 20 million years ago in the age of tertiary the whole region was lying under sea level. At that time it was covered by an ocean which was warm and not very deep. Lots of sediments sank to its bottom. Then the region rose again and the water left, leaving soil which is mostly sandy and poor.
The neighbours of Eppertshausen are: 
Eppertshausen has 5,829 inhabitants (2008).
The climate of the town is mild. There is less rain than in other parts of Germany.
Some local people are speaking a regional type (dialect) of the German language with a certain tone and special words. It is a Hessian dialect (German: "Hessisch") spoken in the south of Hesse. This language type is related to other dialects in the south of Germany. In former times mostly every place had its own special dialect, sometimes hard to understand for people of other parts of Germany. Today the dialect speakers are a minority and the majority of them does not speak the real dialect. They rather speak a kind of regular German with a certain pronunciation.
Eppertshausen is an early place where people lived. In the time of the 7th to the 9th century new places to live got name endings like "-hausen".
In 836 the name of Eppertshausen was written down in a document for the first time. It was owned by the monastery of the nearby city of Seligenstadt.
Formerly the people in Eppertshausen were mostly farmers and craftsmen but not tradesmen. Every family had land to grow their food. When the property was handed to the next generation it was divided within the children. Therefore, most families had only small farms and were poor. With the industrial revolution the Rhine-Main area got lots of factories and developed to a center for metal working, leather manufacturing and chemical processing. Many men became workmen and found a job in the factories and earned money. This increased living conditions partly.

Barack Obama

Barack Hussein Obama II (; born August 4, 1961) is the 44th and current President of the United States and the first African-American to hold the office. He is a Democrat. Obama won the 2008 United States presidential election, on November 4, 2008. He was inaugurated on January 20, 2009.
As president, he slowly ended the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, with intention to prepare the countries so that they could defend themselves. He also signed the Affordable Care Act (often called "Obamacare") which changed many health care laws. He also enacted numerous acts to create public works jobs to help the economy. He became the first president to openly express support for gay marriage, proposed gun control as a result of the Sandy Hook school shooting and has called for improving relations with Cuba.
Obama was born on August 4, 1961 in Kapiʻolani Medical Center for Women and Children (called Kapiʻolani Maternity & Gynecological Hospital in 1961) in Honolulu, Hawaii and is the first President to have been born in Hawaii. His father was a black exchange student from Kenya named Barack Obama Sr. He died in a motorcycle accident in Kenya in 1982. His mother was a white woman from Kansas named Ann Dunham, who was an anthropologist and died from cancer. His mother married Barack Obama Sr. in 1961 and divorced him in 1964. His stepfather was from Indonesia named Lolo Soetoro after his mother married him in 1965. She divorced in 1980. He spent most of his childhood in Hawaii and Chicago, Illinois, although he lived in Indonesia with his mother and stepfather from age 6 to age 10. He moved back to Hawaii after that to live with his grandparents. 
He started college at Occidental College in Los Angeles, and graduated from Columbia University in New York City. After taking time off to community organize, Obama went to law school at Harvard University. After law school, Obama worked for a law firm. The law firm sued companies who fired people, and sued the government claiming that some black people were prevented from voting. 
Obama worked for Alice Palmer, an Illinois state senator. In 1995 she chose not to run for re-election so that she could run for U.S. Congress, and Obama decided to run for her Illinois state senate seat. Palmer lost her election for U.S. Congress, so she tried to keep her seat in the state senate, but she did not have enough time to meet the rules of the election. Obama's team said that she could not be on the ballot, and the election rulemakers agreed. Obama won the election and became an Illinois state senator. He was state senator from 1997 to 2004.
While he was Illinois state senator, he wrote a law that required police to keep records on the race of people they stopped. The law that he wrote also forced police to videotape when they talked to people they suspect of murder. He taught law part-time at the University of Chicago Law School. Judge and political teacher Abner J. Mikva taught Obama politics and became his mentor.
Obama ran for the U.S. Senate. While running for Senate, John Kerry asked him to speak at the Democratic National Convention. He spoke on television. He was a U.S. Senator from 2005 to 2008.
Obama won the presidential election of 2008.
Barack Obama's presidential campaign for the White House started in early June 2008 when he defeated Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primaries. Hillary Clinton was favored to win but Obama won many smaller state caucuses (local party elections) by having a lot of volunteers. He decided not to accept government money for his campaign so that he could accept more money from people. He raised the most amount of money ever for a presidential campaign. 
Obama's campaign theme was that he was a man of hope and change. He was also against the war in Iraq. He was in favor of giving money to American car companies. He was in favor of sending more troops to Afghanistan.
During the campaign, some people said that Obama's friends were Tony Rezko, a landlord, and former member of the Weather Underground Bill Ayers; Obama said that they were not his friends. Obama also had trouble when his minister at church, Jeremiah Wright, was videotaped criticizing America. During the campaign, Obama said that his opponent, Republican candidate John McCain, was just like George W. Bush, something that John McCain said was not true.
He defeated McCain in the election on November 4 by a wide electoral majority of 365 to 173, meaning that he won the most votes in enough states to send 365 people to officially elect him. The popular vote (based on the total number of votes across the country) was closer, with Obama winning 53%, McCain 46%.
Obama has been married to Michelle Obama since 1992. She has a Bachelor of Arts degree from Princeton University, and also a law degree from Harvard Law School. She worked as a lawyer.
They have two daughters, Malia Ann, who was born in 1998 and Natasha ("Sasha"), born in 2001. They lived in Chicago, but moved into the White House on January 20, 2009.
Obama promised his daughters that the family would get a dog if he was elected President. In April 2009, Senator Ted Kennedy,the brother of former President John F. Kennedy, gave Obama one of his dogs, a Portuguese water dog named Bo.
Obama has a half sister who is a teacher in Hawaii. His father died from a car accident in Africa. His mother died of cancer. His maternal grandmother died just before Obama won the election to become President.
Obama became President of the United States on January 20, 2009. The United States was battling a tough recession. He asked Congress to spend an extra $787 billion ($787,000,000,000) to try to end the recession. He called the plan the stimulus bill. The stimulus bill funded many road projects, gave money to schools, gave tax credits to many Americans, and funded many science and research projects.
Obama continued the financial bailout that George W. Bush started, giving billions of dollars to car companies and banks so that they would not go bankrupt. He signed an act written by Barney Frank and Chris Dodd which would regulate Wall Street (the financial industry) to try to prevent another recession like this from happening again. Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which would bring health care reform to the United States, which he said would change the system so that more people can afford health care.
In foreign policy, Obama made a plan to slowly withdraw troops from Iraq, ending the War in Iraq by the end of 2011, while adding more troops to Afghanistan to help the United States win the War in Afghanistan. He also decided that the USA should help in the war against Libya. He has said several times that he wants to improve U.S. relations with the Muslim world.
Obama received the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize on October 9, 2009. He noted that his efforts were humble, but he donated the prize money to several charities.
Although his popularity was very high (around 70% approval) when he entered office, his approval ratings fell to 45% percent during the year of 2010. He has received a lot of criticism from Republicans, conservatives, libertarians, and members of the Tea Party because they believe that the federal government is becoming too big and spending too much money and that his programs are not the best for the country.
With rising deficits (the amount of money the government borrows each month) under his administration, he has called for taxes to be increased on the rich and wealthy Americans, who can afford to pay them. He has criticized his Republican opponents for wanting to cut welfare benefits for the poor and needy rather than raising taxes to help pay down the debt. He also signed the Don't Ask Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010 in 2010 which since 1993 had prevented openly gay men and openly lesbian women from serving in the army. 
Obama has started the ending of the Iraq War and continued the war on terror which resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011. Obama has started a no-fly-zone policy on Libya which ended the civil war in October 2011 with the killing of Muammar al-Gaddafi. On May 9, 2012, he became the first sitting US President to openly support legalizing same-sex marriage.
On December 14, 2012, after the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut occurred, Obama had said, "We're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics". On December 21, 2012, Obama and his White House staff observed a moment of silence because of the school shooting in Connecticut.
On December 21, 2012, Obama nominated John Kerry for United States Secretary of State during his second term. Kerry was sworn in on February 1, 2013.
Before his second term began and still continues, there has been debating of guns because of the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut that happened on December 14, 2012, as well as shootings in the past.
He took his second term inauguration oath in the White House, privately (only his family members could see) on January 20, 2013. Obama was inaugurated for a second term on January 21, 2013 (January 20, 2013 fell on a Sunday) in the United States Capitol, that inauguration was viewed to the public.
He visited South Africa on late June 2013. Prior to visiting South Africa, he visited Senegal. He visited Robben Island, where Mandela was prisoned. He did not meet with Nelson Mandela.
The United States government shutdown occurred on October 1, 2013. On October 17, 2013, Obama signed a bill which ended the United States government shut down.
Obama awarded several people, including former U.S. President Bill Clinton and media mogul Oprah Winfrey for the Presidential Medal of Freedom on November 20, 2013. He has awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to many people, such as Stephen Hawking, Sandra Day O'Connor, Chita Rivera, Loretta Lynn and George H. W. Bush.
On December 5, 2013, he gave a four and a half minute speech of Nelson Mandela after Mandela's death was announced. On December 9, 2013, he departed Washington, D.C. to go to South Africa for Mandela's memorial service. On December 10, 2013, Obama spoke at the memorial service of Nelson Mandela in Soweto, South Africa.
On April 4, 2011 Obama declared that he would stand for re-election for a second term in 2012 in a video titled "It Begins with Us" that he posted on his website and filed election papers with the Federal Election Commission. He was officially nominated for his party's Presidential choice on September 6, 2012. Mitt Romney was officially nominated as his opponent by the Republican party on August 30, 2012. While the election results were very close, Obama easily won the electoral college votes he needed to win a second term. Obama and Romney spent more than $2 billion on advertising during the election campaign.
The start of his second term in 2014, had a few setbacks. With the NSA, people were upset at the Obama Administration that the government was possibly listening to their phone calls. His party (the Democrats) also lost the Congressional elections. Because of disagreements between Democrats and Republicans in Congress, neither side is getting anything done and Obama has resulted in using his Executive Order (his power as president) to help reform things like the immigration system.
He's also supported increasing the minimum wage, requiring women to be paid the same as men at the same job and has called for the first 2 years of college to be fully government-funded for students who study full-time and get good grades.
After the death of Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia, Obama nominated Merrick Garland to replace him on March 16, 2016.

Seven-arm octopus

The seven-arm octopus ("Haliphron atlanticus") is claimed to be the largest octopus. The claim is based on a partial specimen, and the estimation is of a 4 metre length and a weight of 75 kg. The North Pacific giant octopus is its rival in size.
In 2002, a single specimen of giant proportions was caught by fisheries trawling off the eastern Chatham Rise, New Zealand. This specimen, the largest of this species and of all octopuses, was the first validated record of Haliphron from the South Pacific. It had a mantle length of 0.69 m, total length of 2.90 m, and weight of 61.0 kg, although it was incomplete.
The seven-arm octopus gets its name because the male's hectocotylus (a specially modified arm used in egg fertilization) is coiled in a sac beneath the right eye.

Hierarchical database model

In a Hierarchical database model is a data model where the data is organised like a tree. The structure allows repeating information using parent/child relationships: each parent can have many children but each child only has one parent. All attributes of a specific record are listed under an entity type.
In a database, an entity type is the equivalent of a table; each individual record is represented as a row and an attribute as a column. Entity types are related to each other using "1: N" mapping, also known as one-to-many relationships. 
The most recognized and used hierarchical databases are IMS developed by IBM and Windows Registry by Microsoft.

Network model (database)

Database systems use a network model to store their data in a graph. Much like the Hierarchical database model, the nodes of the graph contain information. The information is stored in a graph, so one parent can have many children, and one child can relate to several parents. The model is also known as CODASYL model, because it was originally proposed by the CODASYL consortium (who also developed COBOL).
In a network model, the defining feature is that each record has a link to another record.

Saint Valentine

Saint Valentine is the name of many martyred saints that lived in Ancient Rome. At least three different people named Valentine are said to have died on the 14th of February. Even though nobody knows who exactly Valentine was and where he came from, it has been confirmed that he existed because archaeologists discovered a church dedicated to Valentine.
In the Catholic church, Valentine was the patron of love, young people, and happy marriages.
There are many guesses about how Valentine's Day, a celebration of love, started. One legend says that Valentine, being a priest, performed secret wedding ceremonies when they were outlawed by Emperor Claudius II. When someone discovered that Valentine was breaking the law, he was ordered to be executed.
Another theory is that Valentine helped captive Christians to break out of prison. When he himself was in prison, Valentine may have sent the first love letter to a young girl who liked to visit him.

Seligenstadt

Seligenstadt is a town in the Offenbach Rural District in the state of Hesse, Germany. The town is by the river "Main".
Seligenstadt is in the "Rhine Main area". The town is about 30 km southeast of Frankfurt. The whole area of the town is 30,85 km large and it is 109–118 m above sea level. It is a plain area with no hills.
About 35 to 20 million years ago in the Age of Tertiary the whole region was lying under sea level. At that time it was covered by an ocean which was warm and not very deep. Lots of sediments sank to its bottom. Then the region rose again and the water left, leaving soil which is mostly sandy and poor.
The city consists out of the town "Seligenstadt" and the 2 former independent villages "Froschhausen" and "Klein-Welzheim", both now urban districts of Seligenstadt. On 1 January 1977 they were united.
The neighbours of Seligenstadt are: 
Seligenstadt has 20,221 inhabitants (2008). The climate of the town is mild. There is less rain than in other parts of Germany.
Some local people are speaking a regional type (dialect) of the German language with a certain tone and special words. It is a Hessian dialect (German: "Hessisch"). This language type is related to other dialects in the south of Germany. In former times mostly every place had its own special dialect, sometimes hard to understand for people of other parts of Germany. Today the dialect speakers are a minority and the majority of them do not speak the real dialect. They rather speak a kind of regular German with a certain pronunciation.
Around the year 100 the Romans had fights with the germanic peoples. They built a small castle and some houses in the place. Later people came here to build a village named "Ober-Mulinheim", later changed to "Obermühlheim". The name parts "Mulin-" and "Mühl-" are meaning "mill".
In 815 the name "Obermühlheim" was written down in a document for the first time. Around 830 the owner of the town started to build a great church, the "Einhard-Basilika", and a monastery. In this time also the name was changed from "Obermühlheim" to "Seligenstadt", because people brought some holy bones to the town.
The name Seligenstadt means "place of happiness". There is a story about the name. The emperor Charlemagne had lost his daughter and he found her in the village "Mulinheim". Therefore, the name of the place was changed into "Seligenstadt".
In the 12th century Seligenstadt got the town privileges.
In former times the people in the Seligenstadt area were mostly farmers, craftsmen and tradesmen. Every family had land to grow their food. When the property was handed to the next generation it was divided within the children. Therefore, most families had only small farms and were poor.
In the time period of the industrial revolution the Rhine Main area got many factories and developed to a center for metal working and leather manufacturing, also chemical engineering. Many men got workmen and found a job in the factories and earned money. This made living conditions partly better.

Ahaziah of Israel

Ahaziah or Ochozias (אחזיהו המלך) (Israel, ca. 870 BC – ca. 850 BC) was king of Israel and the son of Ahab and Jezebel. In the Bible, it says that he is very bad, and that he walked in the ways of his evil father King Ahab.
Ahaziah son of Ahab was king of Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years. He "did evil in the eyes of the LORD, because he walked in the ways of his father and mother and in the ways of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin. He served and worshiped Baal and provoked the LORD, the God of Israel to anger, just as his father had done" (1 Kings 22:51 - 53).
After Ahab's death, Moab rebelled from Israel, and Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice of his upper room in Samaria and injured himself. So he sent messengers, saying to them, "Go and consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, to see if I will recover from this injury." 
But God was angry at this, because Ahaziah did not consult him, but only a god of Ekron, so on the way, Elijah went and met the servants, and told them (2 Kings 1:6) as the Lord had instructed him, "Go back to the king who sent you and tell him, 'This is what the Lord says:Is it because there was no God in Israel that you are sending men to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore (Because of this) you will not leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly (surely) die!'" And the messengers did has he was told. At King Ahaziah's questions, they described Elijah as "a man with a garment of hair and with a leather belt around his waist". King Ahaziah recognized him at once, and sent a captain with fifty men to call Elijah.
Now Elijah was sitting on a hill, and the captain called out, "Man of God, the king says, 'Come down!'" but Elijah replied, "If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men!" he did like this the second time, too. Finally, the king sent a third captain with his fifty men, who "...fell on his knees before Elijah..." and bowed before him, humbly asking him to come. Elijah was told by the angel of the Lord to go down, so he went down and told the king again, "You will certainly die!" "So he died, according to the word of the Lord that Elijah had spoken". (2 Kings 1:17, NIV) 
And, according to the Bible, Ahaziah fulfilled the prophecy by dying. Because Ahaziah had no son, Joram became king.

In economics, utility is the amount of satisfaction you get from consuming (using) goods and products. Changes in utility are called "utils", even though there is not really a standard scale for them. For example, a cup of hot chocolate can have 100 utils, and a cup of orange juice 80 utils. One of the most well-known uses of utility, especially in economics, is the utility of money.

Piracy in the Caribbean

"For the movie, see Pirates of the Caribbean."
Piracy in the Caribbean was the terror of the Caribbean Sea, especially to the Spanish navy that controlled those seas. The English had defeated the Spanish Armada in 1588, which stopped the Spanish control of the oceans. However, the Spanish still controlled the Caribbean. 
In the 1770s, the English used pirates to help their government. By doing harm to the Spanish navy and export, the English hoped to get more land in the New World and stop the Spanish from controlling the New World trade. They did get what they wanted, but made a new problem.
Sir Henry Morgan was one well-known pirate who was encouraged by the English government. He worked for the government, but he kept the money. As time went on, though, Morgan stopped working for the government and began working to get money only for himself. He and other pirates soon began attacking any trading ship, even if it was English.
Morgan and his helpers called themselves the Brethren. They wore rough shirts, knee-long pants, felt hats, and leather belts. On their belts, they hung gunpowder , butcher's knives, and blunderbusses (short muskets.) They had a "pirate code" which said each man had the right to vote on all things, like choosing a captain or the next ship to attack.
The pirates easily found new members. Seamen in naval services often lived much harder lives than pirates. They could be punished cruelly by people higher than them, did not have good food to eat, and were paid only a little money. The pirates offered equality, good food (when it was there), and a chance to become rich.
However, pirates were little better. The commanders of trading ships were terrified at seeing pirate ships, because pirates had little mercy on the people they captured. They shot them, beat them to death, tortured them, or them on desert islands. Pirates were not very kind to each other, either. Even though they had a "pirate law", they argued with each other, and members could receive the same punishment as their enemies.
Life on a pirate ship was very hard. There was never a dry place to sleep; bathing was very rare; food was often bad; and danger was expected. Many pirates had missing arms or legs after bloody sea battles. Even pirates who finally became rich still risked being hanged if they were caught.

Ceratopsia

The Ceratopsia are the horned dinosaurs of the order Ornithischia. "Triceratops" is the best-known, and one of the largest. They are a group of herbivorous, beaked dinosaurs which thrived in what is now North America and Asia, during the Cretaceous period.
Ancestral forms of this group lived earlier, in the Jurassic. Early members, such as "Psittacosaurus", were small and bipedal. 
Later members, including "Centrosaurus" and "Triceratops", became very large quadrupeds. They developed elaborate facial horns and a neck frill. The frill served mainly to protect the vulnerable neck from bipedal predators like Tyrannosaurus, who attacked from above. 
The frill was no doubt also used in display, thermoregulation, the attachment of large neck and chewing muscles or some combination of the above. 
Ceratopsians ranged in size from 1 meter (3 ft) and 23 kilograms (50 lb) to over 9 meters (30 ft) and 5,400 kg (12,000 lb).
"Triceratops" is by far the best-known ceratopsian to the general public.

Pachycephalosaur

The Pachycephalosaurs are a group of ornithopod dinosaurs in the suborder Cerapoda. Their thick round skulls were used for defence and, probably, for mating contests.
In some species, the skull roof is domed and several inches thick; in others it is flat or wedge-shaped.The flat-headed pachycephalosaurs are usually regarded as distinct species or even families, but they may be juveniles of dome-headed adults. The domes were often surrounded by nodes and/or spikes.
There is evidence of head-butting in pachycephalosaurs. Of 100 domes studied, 20 percent showed signs of healed injuries, all consistent with combative behavior. The pathologies included pitting where the bone had become infected from wounds that originated in the skin. These findings suggest that pachycephalosaurids may have been using their heads for both display and defence as many modern animals do.

The Huayangosauridae were an early family of stegosaurs which lived during the Middle Jurassic. They were smaller than later stegosaurs and had shorter and higher skulls. Currently, the only confirmed genus included is the type genus "Huayangosaurus" of China. The poorly-known remains of "Regnosaurus" from England, however, indicate it too could be a member. Its lower jaw is very similar to the former.

Offenbach Rural District

Offenbach Rural District is a rural district () in the south of Hesse, Germany. It is a part of the Darmstadt Government Region ().
The Offenbach Rural District is in the middle of the "Rhine Main area" in the south of the state of Hesse. The district is in the metropolitan area of Frankfurt. In the east it touches the state of Bavaria.
The whole area of the district is 356.29 km large and it is about 100 – 150 m above sea level. It is a mostly plain area with only a few hills. The district is southwest of the river "Main". The municipalities "Mainhausen" and "Hainburg" and the cities "Seligenstadt" and "Mühlheim" are near the river.
There are two creeks, the Rodau and the Bieber running from south to north through the district. They are flowing to the river "Main".
About 35 to 20 million years ago in the age of tertiary the whole region was lying under sea level. At that time it was covered by an ocean which was warm and not very deep. Lots of sediments sank to its bottom. Then the region rose again and the water left, leaving soil which is mostly sandy and poor.
The district has 336,818 inhabitants (2008). The climate of the area is mild. There is less rain than in other parts of Germany.
Since 1977 the "Offenbach Rural District" has 10 cities and 3 independent villages. In the year 2002 "Dietzenbach" became the capital of the district. The city of Offenbach is not a part of the district.
The neighbouring cities and rural districts of the Offenbach Rural District are the following:
In the year 1832 the Offenbach Rural District was founded. The capital was Offenbach. In 1938 the city of Offenbach became an independent urban district, but the rural district administration still was in Offenbach. In 2002 the capital changed and now "Dietzenbach" is the new capital of the Offenbach Rural District.

A Leap of faith commonly refers to believing something that cannot be touched or proved by science, for which there is no evidence. Usually the term is attributed to Søren Kierkegaard, even though he never really used it. According to Kierkegaard, such a leap involves circular reasoning, because a leap is made by faith.
A leap of faith is commonly associated with religious belief because many religions consider faith to be an essential element of piety.

<doc id="223773" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=223773" title="Capoeira">
Capoeira

Capoeira is a combination of martial art, sport and popular culture that developed out in Brazil, by African slaves and Brazilian natives, starting in the 16th century. It was made to give slaves a chance to escape and to survive. Capoeira was illegal in Brazil until the 1930s.
Capoeira uses strong and fast kicks, dodges and fast counter-attacks. It also uses acrobatics and simple take-downs.
Capoeira's history probably begins with the beginning of African slavery in Brazil. When Portuguese colonists began exporting West African slaves, Brazil, with its vast territory, received most of the slaves, almost 40% of all slaves sent through the Atlantic Ocean.
Although rebellions were rare, capoeira was invented as a hope of survival for slaves if they managed to escape, as after an escape attempt, colonial agents were sent after the escapees. The martial arts was incorporated into a dance, to escape detection–with music and rhythmic moves, no suspicion could be raised regarding potential martial art training. Due to city growth, more slaves were brought to cities and so made capoeira more prominent and allowed it to be taught and practiced among more people. In Rio the colonial government tried to suppress it and established severe physical punishments to its practice.
After slavery was abolished in 1888, free former people had nowhere to live, no jobs and were thought to the public as lazy workers. Capoeira then found a new role—as a dance of criminals.
They used capoeiristas (capoeira dancers) as bodyguards and hitmen. In 1890, the Brazilian government prohibited capoeira as police identified it as an advantage in fighting and they didn’t want criminals to have this advantage. After this, anybody caught practising capoeira for any reason would be arrested and tortured by the police. Some practises still occurred in remote places with guards to warn of police.
By the 1920s, capoeira repression had declined. Mestre Bimba from Salvador, a strong fighter in both legal and illegal fights, thought capoeira was losing its martial roots due to the use of its playful side to entertain tourists. Bimba began developing the first systematic training method for capoeira, and in 1932 founded the first capoeira school and he called it Luta Regional Baiana as capoeira was illegal in name. By 1940, capoeira was legalized.
Today, capoeira is viewed as one of the symbols of Brazilian culture all around the world and in 1970 it was taught outside of Brazil for the first time. Capoeira presentations, normally theatrical and with little martiality, are common sights around the world.
The martial art part however, is still present and still disguised, just as it was in the time of slavery, and trickery is still present and expert dancers used. An attack can be disguised even as a friendly gesture, such is the expertise gone into the research of new moves. Capoeira is now a symbol of Brazilian culture, its ethnic amalgam, and of resistance to oppression.

Vaishnavism

Vaishnavism () is a tradition of Hinduism. Its followers worship Vishnu or its avatars, mainly Rama and Krishna as the highest, or original God. This worship in different perspectives or historical traditions addresses God under the names of Narayana, Krishna, Vāsudeva or more often "Vishnu", and their associated avatars. Its beliefs and practices, especially the concepts of Bhakti and Bhakti Yoga, are based largely on the Upanishads, and associated with the Vedas and Puranic texts such as the Bhagavad Gita, and the Padma, Vishnu and Bhagavata Puranas.
The followers of Vaishnavism are referred to as "Vaishnava(s)" or "Vaishnavites". A large percentage of Hindus are Vaishnavas, with the vast majority living in India. Awareness, recognition, and growth of the belief has significantly increased outside of India in recent years. The Gaudiya Vaishnava branch of the tradition has significantly increased the awareness of Vaishnavism internationally, since the mid-1900s, largely through the activities and geographical expansion of the Hare Krishna movement, primarily through ISKCON and more recently, through several other Vaishnava organizations conducting preaching activities in the West.

Oracle Corporation is an American company. It makes hardware systems and enterprise software ("software for businesses") such as database management systems. Its headquarters are in Redwood City, California, United States. The founder is Lary Ellison. In 2010, it employed 105,000 people worldwide. It has increased in size through natural growth and by buying other companies. By 2007 Oracle had the third-largest software revenue, after Microsoft and IBM.
In January 2010 it bought Sun Microsystems.
The corporation has arguably become best known for its flagship product, the Oracle Database. The company also builds tools for database development and systems of middle-tier software, enterprise resource planning software (ERP), customer relationship management software (CRM) and supply chain management (SCM) software.
, Larry Ellison, a co-founder of Oracle Corporation, has served as Oracle's CEO throughout its history. He also served as the Chairman of the Board until his replacement by Jeffrey O. Henley in 2004. On August 22, 2008 the Associated Press ranked Ellison as the top-paid chief executive in the world.
When the company started, computer database technology was only starting. Ellison had read a 1970 paper written by Edgar F. Codd on relational database management systems (RDBMS).
He had also heard about the IBM System R database from an article in the "IBM Research Journal" by Ed Oates. System R was also based on Codd's theories. Ellison wanted to make Oracle's product compatible with System R, but IBM stopped this by keeping the error codes for their DBMS ("DataBase Management System") secret. Ellison co-founded Oracle Corporation in 1977 with Bob Miner and Ed Oates under the name Software Development Laboratories (SDL). In 1979 SDL changed its name to Relational Software, Inc. (RSI). In 1982, RSI renamed itself Oracle Systems to make the relation to its main product, Oracle Database, clearer. At this stage Bob Miner was the company's senior programmer. In 1995, Oracle Systems Corporation changed its name to Oracle Corporation.
Part of Oracle Corporation's early success came from using the C programming language to install its products. This made changing the setup to different operating systems (most of which support C) easier.

<doc id="223790" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=223790" title="Queen (butterfly)">
Queen (butterfly)

The Queen ("Danaus gilippus") is a species of butterfly. It belongs in the family Nymphalidae. It is found in North America, Central America, and South America.
The upper side of the wings is dark reddish-brown. It has black wing borders. Males have an androconium (a spot that releases scents to attract females) on each of his hind wings (bottom wings). The underside of the wings is reddish-brown. The wings have black borders. There are white spots in the black borders. The hind wing has black veins.
The Queen is one species in a complex mimicry ring. Where their range overlaps, the appearance of these butterflies is similar. The Monarch ("Danaus plexippus") is orange. It has thick, black veins. The Viceroy ("Limenitis archippus") is smaller. It has thick, black veins. It has a black band across the hind wing. The Soldier ("Danaus eresimus") has thin black veins. On the underside of the hind wing, there is a row of pale, square-shaped spots.
Monarchs are bad-tasting and poisonous because they contain a chemical known as cardenolide (cardiac glycoside). The chemical slows the heart-beat of vertebrates. Monarch caterpillars get this chemical when they feed on milkweed. 
When the Monarch becomes a butterfly, it no longer eats milkweed, but it still has the chemical in its body. The butterfly shows that they are not good to eat with their bright orange and black wings. This is warning coloration. A bird may try to eat a Monarch, but it will become sick and vomit after eating it. After this experience, the bird learns not to eat another Monarch, and also any other butterfly which is similar in appearance. 
The Viceroy is similar looking to the Monarch, but does not have the milkweed poison in its body. Birds that have had the bad experience of eating a Monarch will usually not eat a Viceroy. It is an example of Batesian mimicry. Or so it was thought; but recent work has challenged this. The difficulty in doing this kind of research is that a butterfly may be toxic in one part of its range, and good to eat in another part. A lot depends on the plants on which the eggs are laid.
The Queen is one of many insects that derives chemical defenses against its predators from its food plant. Most of the toxic cardenolides that make queens so unpalatable to its predators are sequestered from larval host plants. Basically, the Queen shares a Müllerian mimicry with the Monarch. However, the extent of its toxicity varies a great deal in different parts of its range. Micro-geographic differences in the environment lead to variation in the dynamics of mimetic relationships even at a local level.
The Queen can be seen all year in Texas, Arizona, and southern Florida. It is seen from February to December in northern Florida. It is seen from April to November in southern California and southern Nevada.
This butterfly can be found in open places such as open woodlands, fields, deserts, marshes, and forest edges.
The female lays her eggs singly. They are laid on the leaves, stems, and flowers of the host plant (the host plant is the plant that the caterpillar feeds on). The egg is pale green. The caterpillar is banded with yellow and black. There are three pairs of black body extensions. The first pair is near the head. The second pair is on the thorax. The third pair is near the end of the body. The chrysalis is green. It has gold spots. There is a black and gold band on the abdomen. It is very similar to the Monarch's chrysalis. It has three or more broods (a brood is a group of offspring) per year.
Here is a list of host plants that the Queen caterpillar feeds on:

Conservation of mass

The law of conservation of mass states that mass can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. Thus, the amount of matter cannot change. Antoine Lavoisier promoted this idea. 
This law says that when a chemical reaction rearranges atoms into a new product, the mass of the reactants (chemicals before the chemical reaction) is the same as the mass of the products (the new chemicals made). More simply, whatever you do, you will still have the same amount of stuff. 
Broader account: In any chemical reaction, nuclear reaction, or radioactive decay in an isolated system, the total mass of the starting materials must be equal to the mass of the products.
The principle of conservation of mass was first outlined by Mikhail Lomonosov (1711–1765) in 1748. He proved it by experiments—though this is sometimes challenged. Antoine Lavoisier (1743–1794) had expressed these ideas in 1774. Others whose ideas pre-dated the work of Lavoisier include Joseph Black (1728–1799), Henry Cavendish (1731–1810), and Jean Rey (1583–1645).

Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex

Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex, KG, PC (c. 1485 – 28 July 1540) was an English statesman and lawyer. He was King Henry VIII's chief minister (like Prime Minister) from 1532 to 1540. He held many important posts, ending as Lord Chamberlain. Cromwell did not come from a rich or noble family: he rose in life by his work and merit.
Cromwell tried to modernize government, but this meant that both the nobility and the church would have less power. Because of this he was seen as an upstart. He was one of the strongest supporters of the English Reformation, the English Church's break with the papacy in Rome. Henry VIII was made the head of the Church of England by Parliament in 1534. Cromwell helped control the new Church with his two new jobs; Vicegerent for spirituals and Vicar general.
Cromwell had supported Henry VIII in disposing of Anne Boleyn and replacing her with Jane Seymour. During his years as the King's chief minister, Cromwell created many powerful enemies for himself.
His final downfall was caused by the haste with which he encouraged the king to marry Anne of Cleves. This was a marriage that Cromwell hoped would put the English Reformation back on track after the recent setback with the Six Articles. The enterprise became a disaster when King Henry told Cromwell that he had not consummated the marriage. Henry told Cromwell to get him out of the marriage by legal means, but the king was obliged to go ahead with it or risk the vital German alliance. The king's marriage to Anne of Cleves was a disaster for Cromwell. It was the opportunity that Cromwell's opponents (most notably the Duke of Norfolk) needed to press for his downfall.
Cromwell was executed at Tyburn on 28 July 1540, the same day that the king divorced Anne of Cleves and married Catherine Howard. After his execution, Cromwell's head was boiled and then set upon a spike on London Bridge, facing away from the City of London. 
Henry came to regret Cromwell's execution. About eight months afterwards, Henry accused his ministers of bringing about Cromwell's downfall by false charges. Henry spent the rest of his life lamenting the fact that Cromwell had been executed.
Oliver Cromwell, the revolutionary leader who overthrew the British monarchy and led a short-lived republican government in the 17th century, was a descendant of Thomas Cromwell's sister, Catherine Cromwell (born circa 1482).

Photolithography is the combination of photography and lithography. Its uses include the mass printing of photographs. Microphototolithography is the use of photolithography to transfer geometric shapes on a photomask to the surface of a semiconductor wafer for making integrated circuits.
Photolithography makes integrated circuits such as memory and central processing units.
A special light-and-shadow pattern is shone through a photomask, onto a sheet or wafer of silicon that had been covered with a material called a photoresist. The light hardens the photoresist. When the board is dipped into a special acid, the parts that had no light on them are dissolved away.

Macropod

Macropods are marsupials belonging to the family Macropodidae. That family includes kangaroos, wallabies, tree-kangaroos, pademelons, and several others. They are native to Australia, New Guinea, and their surrounding islands. Before European settlement, there were about 65 species of Macropods. Six species have since become extinct. Another 11 species have been greatly reduced in numbers.
Modern Macropods are herbivores. They have specialized teeth made for grinding up fibrous plants. Macropods usually have a row of broad, straight front teeth, no canines, and a gap before their large molars. 
The stomachs of the Macropods contain lots of bacteria that help them to digest their food by breaking it down for them. Macropods have a certain blend of bacteria in their stomachs that lowers the amount of methane produced.
Macropods come in all different sizes. Almost all have a powerful tail and large back legs. The word Macropod comes from the Greek "large foot". These long legs allow Macropods to move quickly, and for long distances.
Gestation lasts approximately one month. In larger species, it lasts a little longer. Usually a single offspring is born. It attaches itself to a teat inside the mother's pouch. The offspring is able to leave the pouch after 5-11 months. It is sexually mature at 1-3 years old, depending on the species. 
Marsupials evolved about 160 million years ago during the Jurassic period. The oldest Macropod fossil found is about 12 million years old.

Alveolus

An alveolus (plural: alveoli) is a word used in anatomy for hollow cavities, which are empty areas within a body.
Although there are many different types of alveoli in the body, the word alveoli is usually used to talk about small air sacs in the lungs of mammals. These are also called "pulmonary alveoli". These alveoli are located at the ends of the air passageways in the lungs. They have very thin (one cell thick), wet walls and are surrounded with a network of small blood vessels, or capillaries. This allows gases to diffuse, or move across, the surface of the alveolus.
When a mammal breathes in, the concentration of oxygen is higher in the alveolus than in the red blood cells. Therefore, oxygen leaves the alveolus and enters the red blood cells. When a mammal breathes out, the opposite happens. The concentration of carbon dioxide is lower in the alveolus than in the red blood cells, so carbon dioxide leaves the red blood cells, enters the alveolus, and is exhaled.
In an average human lung, there are 480 million alveoli. Their total surface area is around 75 square meters.
Inside the alveoli is where a gas exchange occurs. Gas exchange is a biological process through which (usually two) different gases are transferred in opposite directions across a specialised respiratory surface. Gases are constantly required and produced as a by-product of cellular and metabolic reactions so an efficient system for their exchange is extremely important. It is linked with respiration in animals, and both respiration and photosynthesis in plants.

<doc id="224028" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=224028" title="Parasitoid">
Parasitoid

Parasitoids are parasites whose larvae develop inside another organism's body. This usually results in the death of the host, which sets them apart from 'traditional' parasites. There are twelve superfamilies of parasitic wasps which are entirely or mainly parasitoid. The largest family are the ichneumons, with over 80,000 species. 
In parasitoids the adult stage is free-living: it finds the 'host' for the next generation. Their mother places them, as eggs, on or in the body of a 'host', which provides food for their growth. 
Normal parasites use vectors as their main means of getting to other hosts. 
In Hymenoptera, there are many variations, and the distinction between the 'parasitic' and the 'traditional' hymenoptera can run very thin. 
In Britain there are about 6500 species of Hymenoptera more than in any other insect order and just one of the parasitoid superfamilies, Ichneumonoidea, contains nearly half of them. Most workers now recognise only two families in Ichneumonoidea. These are Ichneumonidae, with over two thousand British species, and Braconidae, with nearly 1200 representatives in Britain. They are, respectively, the largest and the second largest families of British insects. Only a beetle family, the Staphylinidae, is near the thousand mark. Ichneumonoids also include the largest parasitoids.
Hymenopteran parasitoids often have unique life cycles. In one family, the Trigonalidae, the female wasps deposit eggs into small pockets they cut into the edge of leaves with their ovipositor. A caterpillar chewing these leaves may swallow some of the eggs. When they get into the caterpillar's gut, they hatch and burrow through the gut wall and into the body cavity. Later they search the caterpillar's body cavity for other parasitoid larvae, and it is these they attack and feed on. Some trigonalids, once in a caterpillar or sawfly larva, need their host to fall prey to a social wasp. The wasp carries the caterpillar back to its nest, and there it is butchered and fed to the wasp's young. The young serve as host for the trigonalid, the eggs of which are in the butchered caterpillar.

In entomology, the imago is the last stage in the development of an insect. In an incomplete metamorphosis it comes after the last ecdysis. If the metamorphosis is complete, it comes after emergence from the pupa. This is the only stage where the insect is sexually mature and (if a winged species) has functional wings. The imago is often referred to as the "adult stage".

He was a first cousin to the late President of Iraq Saddam Hussein. During the 1980s and 1990s, he became notorious for his role in the Iraqi government's campaigns against internal opposition forces, namely the ethnic Kurdish rebels of the north, and the Shia religious dissidents of the south. Repressive measures included deportations of the population and mass killings; al-Majid was dubbed "Chemical Ali" by Iraqi Kurds for his use of chemical weapons in attacks against them.
Al-Majid was captured after the 2003 invasion of Iraq and was charged with war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. He was convicted in June 2007 and was sentenced to death for crimes committed in the al-Anfal campaign of the 1980s. His appeal against the death sentence was rejected on 4 September 2007, and was sentenced to death for the fourth time on 17 January 2010. Al-Majid was executed by hanging eight days later.

Welty worked as a publicity agent for the work progress administration. She had to travel around Mississippi for her job. In her own time, she took memorable photographs. These mostly show how different people from all economic and social classes coped with the Great Depression. Collections of her photograph were published as "One time, One place" (1971) and "Photograph" (1989). 
Very often, a photograph was the basis of one of her short stories, including "Why I live at the P.O.", which was inspired by a woman she photographed ironing in the back of a small post office.

Henry James OM (18431916) was an Anglo-American novelist. He was one of the most important literary people of the late 19th century. James was the son of Henry James Senior, a clergyman, and the brother of William James, the psychologist and philosopher. He grew up mostly in the United States but spent the majority of his life in England. He became a British citizen in 1915. His sister, Alice James, was also a writer. 
In his novels, he wrote from the viewpoint of one of the characters. Some literary critics compared this to impressionist painting. In his own literary criticism, James insisted that writers be allowed the greatest possible freedom in how they looked at the world. He thought a text should be realistic, and its account of life be recognisable to its readers. Good novels, to James, show life in action and are interesting. 
He published fictional books, articles and books of travel, biography, autobiography, and criticism, and wrote plays, some of which were performed during his lifetime. His plays probably influenced his later novels and tales.

Velupillai Prabhakaran

Velupillai Prabhakaran (November 26 1954 — May 18 2009) was the leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. He fought to make an independent state for the Tamil people in the north of Sri Lanka. Under his leadership, the Tamil Tigers became one of the most deadly guerilla groups in the world.
Prabhakaran was born in Valvettiturai, a fishing town, on the northern tip of Sri Lanka. His father worked for the government. After Ceylon became independent in 1948, life became very difficult for the small Tamil population. There were laws to limit their chance of getting to university or working for the government. In 1972, Prabhakaran started a group called the Tamil New Tigers (TNT). In July 1975 he shot dead Alfred Duryappa, the mayor of Jaffna. Duryappa was also a Tamil, but Prahbhakaran believed he had become too close to the Sri Lankan government.
Prabhakaran went to India to escape from the police. He hid in the city of Madras (now Chenai), where he turned the TNT into the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Each member had cyanide (poison) carried in a necklace which they could swallow if they were captured. Other rules that Prabhakaran made for the LTTE were that members could not smoke, drink alcohol or have sex. The last rule was changed when Prabhakaran married Mathivathani Erambu. The LTTE secretly set up training camps in India. Other Tamil guerilla groups were taken over or destroyed by the LTTE.
In July 1983, there were wide spread attacks against Tamils in Sri Lanka. Many Tamils left the country, and many young people went to the training camps in India. The LTTE fought against the government. They had their own navy, the Sea Tigers, and air force. In July 1987 Prabhakaran started a group called the "Black Tigers". These were a group of male and female suicide bombers. Their explosive belts have been copied by groups in Palestine, Chechnya and Iraq. India sent 100,000 peace keeping soldiers to Sri Lanka in July 1987. The Indian government and the Sri Lankan government signed an agreement, but Prabhakaran did not like it because it did not create a separate Tamil country. The Indian soldiers were soon fighting against the LTTE.
The Indian army left Sri Lanka in March 1990, having had 1200 soldiers killed. Prabhakaran became ruler of the northern part of Sri Lanka. He attacked everyone he thought was responsible for the war. In May 1991, female suicide bombers killed the former Indian Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, during an election rally. Prabhakaran did not trust other people. He would only drink his own bottled water, he slept with a gun under his pillow. He thought his cousin, Mahattaya, was plotting against him. He had him and many others tortured and killed.
In 2001, the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE asked Norway to help make a ceasefire to stop the war. This lasted for four years before the fighting started again. This led to increased attacks on the LTTE by the Sri Lankan army. The LTTE were slowly forced back into a very small area. Prabhakaran and his son, Charles Anthony, were killed in the fighting, and the LTTE were defeated.

Mohs scale of mineral hardness

Mohs scale of mineral hardness is named after the scientist, Friedrich Mohs, who invented a scale of hardness based on the ability of one mineral to scratch another. Rocks are made up of one or more minerals. According to the scale, Talc is the softest: it can be scratched by all other materials. Gypsum is harder: it can scratch talc but not calcite, which is even harder. The hardness of a mineral is mainly controlled by the strength of the bonding between the atoms and partly by the size of the atoms. It is a measure of the resistance of the mineral to scratching.
The Mohs scale is for natural minerals. For manufactured products other measures of hardness are better.
Diamond is always at the top of the scale, being the hardest mineral. There are ten minerals in Mohs scale, talc, gypsum, calcite, fluorite, apatite, orthoclase, quartz, topaz, corundum, and for last and hardest, diamond. Because the Mohs scale was made long ago, it is not exactly correct - for example, several minerals are now known to be harder than the diamond. The Mohs scale may not be perfect, but field geologists still find it very useful.

Friedrich Mohs

Friedrich Mohs was a scientist who studied minerals and rocks, a German minerologist.
Scientist Mohs was born in Germany, and he was a minerologist who studied minerals, chemistry, physics, and mathematics. He was born in 1773, January 29th, and died in 1839, September 29.
He moved to Austria in 1801 where he found a job identifying minerals in a collection that belonged to a rich banker. He used physical characteristics of the crystals to decide what they were. One of the characteristics he used to identify minerals was hardness. 
He knew that some of the minerals could scratch others and that if a mineral could make a scratch on another, it must be harder than the mineral that was scratched. He found that all minerals could scratch the mineral talc, so it must be very soft. He also found that diamonds were so hard that no other minerals could scratch them. 
About ten years later, Friedrich made a scale from one to 10 to describe mineral hardness. He gave harder minerals larger numbers and softer minerals smaller numbers. Talc, the softest mineral, he assigned to one, the smallest number on the scale. Diamond, the hardest mineral, he assigned to 10, the largest number on the scale. This scale was called Mohs scale of mineral hardness, named after Friedrich Mohs.
In 1812, Mohs became professor in Graz; in 1818, professor in Freiberg, Saxony; in 1826, professor in ViennaIn 1817, Mohs replaced his mentor Werner, who had died, as a tutor at the mining academy in Freiberg, where he worked for nine years, until he was appointed as a professor of Mineralogy at the University of Vienna.
Mohs ended his remarkable career as a mining advisor at the Mining University in Leoban and died aged 66, while holidaying in Italy.

Chelicerata

The Chelicerata are a sub-phylum of the Arthropods. The sub-phylum consists of only two classes: the Arachnids and the Merostomata. 
The Merostomata are the extinct Eurypterids and the horseshoe crabs (Xiphosura). The horseshoe crabs are a small, ancient group which has survived relatively unchanged for millions of years. Groups like this are often called living fossils. The Arachnida is the huge and successful terrestrial (air-breathing) group of spiders and their relatives.
The chelicerates originated as marine animals. The first confirmed chelicerate fossils, the eurypterids, date from 445 million years ago in the late Ordovician period. Although only four marine species survive, all of them horseshoe crabs, there are over 77,000 species of air-breathing chelicerates, and there may be about 500,000 unidentified species. 
The pycnogonids may or may not be Chelicerates. This is in dispute, as genetic evidence suggests they may be an ancient sister group to all other living arthropods. There are 1,300 species of these 'sea spiders'. 
The life-style of chelicerates is largely carnivorous, or other kinds of heterotroph.

Avoidant personality disorder (AvPD) is a type of personality disorder, a long-term mental illness.
People diagnosed with avoidant personality disorder are socially inhibited, meaning that they are shy and afraid of social situations. They feel that they are not good people and are afraid of people rejecting them. They are very sensitive to other people saying bad or negative things about them.
Psychiatrists and other mental health professionals diagnose people with AvPD using a book called the "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders" (DSM-IV-TR). They look at a person's behaviour and how they are feeling. If the person has four or more of the following signs, the DSM-IV-TR says that they have AvPD.
The symptoms of AvPD are much more serious than ordinary shyness.

Cassiopeia was a woman in Greek mythology. She was the wife of Cepheus who was king of a place called Ethiopia. This is not the same place as the African country called Ethiopia. They had a daughter called Andromeda. Cassiopeia was very beautiful but also very arrogant and vain. She thought that she was better than other people. One day, Cassiopeia said that her daughter Andromeda was more beautiful than all of the Nereids. The Nereids were sea-nymphs. When the sea-god Poseidon heard what Cassiopeia had said, he was very angry. He sent floods and a sea monster called Cetus to destroy Ethiopia. Cassiopeia and her husband Cepheus asked an oracle what to do. The oracle said that they must sacrifice their daughter so they chained Andromeda to a rock. A hero called Perseus came and rescued Andromeda. Later, they got married.
Poseidon was still angry with Cassiopeia and wanted to punish her. He placed her in the sky. There is a constellation called Cassiopeia named after her.

David Chalmers

David Chalmers was born in 1966. He has lived in Australia all of his life.
Since 2004 he has been a professor of philosophy at the Australian National University.
He has challenged other philosophers to solve the "Hard Problem of consciousness". This is the problem of explaining the relationship between physical and mental states. For example, the brain has a physical way of processing information and this makes an experience, a mental state.

Panpsychism

Panpsychism is the theory that everything in the universe is somewhat sentient or conscious. They are all connected parts of the whole. 
Panpsychists believe that all matter in the universe has some degree of consciousness.In other words the substance of the universe is composed entirely of mind or consciousness. This is not to say that rocks have a mind but that the individual atoms and other particles in the rock have some sort of awareness and are aware of each other. Panpsychism is opposed to materialism or any doctrine that argues that the reality of the universe is composed solely of matter. Panpsychism needs no supernatural miracle to explain consciousness, it is consciousness. In other words we are all part of a grand communication scheme which is the glue that holds the universe together.

Prosauropod

Prosauropods were a group of early herbivorous dinosaurs that lived during the later Triassic and early Jurassic periods. 
They were the largest herbivores in their environment, and quickly reached (6 to 10 meters long). All prosauropods had a long neck and small head, forelimbs shorter than the hindlimbs, and a very large thumb claw for defense. They were originally thought to be the ancestors of the sauropods, but are now considered by some as a parallel lineage.

<doc id="224411" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=224411" title="Drosera">
Drosera

Drosera, sometimes called Sundews, are carnivorous plants. They use a thick gluey goo called "mucilage" to trap and digest their prey.The mucilage is attached to special hairs called trichomes. They are one of the most common carnivorous plants. They have at least 188 species. They are found everywhere in the world except Antarctica. Many sundews species usually live for two or more years. Others live for only one year and reproduce by seed. Some sundew species can live for 50 years.
Its scientific name is from the Greek δρόσος: "drosos" = "dew, dewdrops". Its English name is "sundew", from Latin "ros solis", meaning "dew of the sun". Both names describe the sweet-smelling, sticky (goo) that comes down the ends of on each flower . This mucilage rolls down the plant, attracting sugar-loving insects day and night. The mucilage has enzymes which digests them so that the plants can get the nitrogen it needs from it. Like all plants, the sundew makes its own food, and just uses insects for nitrogen and other nutrients. These tiny flowering plants are about tall, about as tall as an adult's hand, though some climbing sundews can be much taller. One species of sundew, the "Drosera erythrogyne", grew up to . Sundew roots are not very strong. They are usually simply for taking in water and keeping the sundew firmly planted to the ground.
A fly, butterfly, or other nectar-loving insect will find the sweet smell of the mucilage that oozes from the plant. Landing on the colorful tip, the insect will immediately be stuck. The plant has cells that make more mucilage in the place where the insect is. The gooey mucilage will completely the insect. Then, the sundew plant wraps its outside tentacles around the insect, absorbing its nutrients. It curls its tentacles around the insect quite quickly: in some species this takes only a few seconds. Some species, like "Drosera glanduligera" can curl its tentacles towards its prey in less than a second. Many sundews can bend parts of themselves so that the prey will be as sticky as possible. One species, "Drosera capensis", actually wraps its leaf around the prey in 30 minutes, as seen in the picture on the right. The prey usually dies in about 15 minutes. The sundew will then eat the entire insect except the outside exoskeleton. When the plant has finished eating, it opens up its tentacles and drops the exoskeleton to the ground.
Sundews have also been used in herbal medicine for a long time. Today they are still used to stop coughs, asthma, and lung .
Because they are carnivorous (eat living things), and because of the beauty of the dew-like mucilage on their tentacles, sundews are also popular as ornamental plants. However, they can be quite hard to grow: they need lots of water (their soil usually has to keep on being very wet), and this water has to be pure (without minerals inside it), because this can stop them from growing or even kill them.
Parts of sundews were also eaten by Australian Aborigines.

Flag of Colorado

The Flag of the State of Colorado has three horizontal stripes of the same width; the top and bottom stripes are blue, and the middle stripe white. On top of these stripes sits a circular red "C", filled with a golden disk. The blue is meant to represent the skies, the gold stands for the sunshine enjoyed by the state, the white represents the snowcapped mountains and the red represents the earth.
The flag was thought up by Andrew Carlisle Johnson in 1911 and adopted by the state's General Assembly on June 5 of the same year. 
However, the legislature did not specify the size of the "C" or the exact shade of blue or red. Because of this, some flags were in slightly different colors and had the "C" wholly within the center stripe. On February 28, 1929, the General Assembly added to the statement that the flag would be the same color blue and red as the flag of the United States. On March 31, 1964, the legislature further dictated the diameter of the gold disc to be equal to the center stripe.

Blue-throated hummingbird

The blue-throated hummingbird, ("Lampornis clemenciae"), is a species of hummingbird. It is a good sized hummingbird, 11.5 to 12.5 cm (4½ to 5 inches) in length and 6 to 10 grams in weight. 
The blue-throated hummingbird is darkish green on the top of its body, blending to medium gray on its belly. It has a bright white stripe behind its eye and a narrower stripe reaching backward from the corner of its bill, bordering a blackish cheek patch. Its tail feathers are iridescent blue-black with broad white tips on the outer two to three pairs. 
The species gets its name from the adult male's iridescent blue throat patch (gorget). The female does not have this. Instead it has a plain grey throat. Males sing two types of songs: a simple "peep song", which sounds like a squeaky wheel, and a quiet but hard "whisper song". The female is also thought to sing during the breeding season to attract males.

Elephant seal

The Elephant Seal is a huge seal of the genus Mirounga. There are two species, one in each hemisphere. The southern elephant seal, is found in Antarctic waters, while the northern elephant seal lives on islands of California and Mexico. The elephant seal is the largest amphibious animal. The bulls have a huge proboscis, and may weigh 750 lbs, and 8ft in length at maturity although old males can approach 11 ft long and weigh 1,375 lbs in rare cases.
Outside the breeding season, elephant seals come ashore only to shed their skin, a process known as "moulting". In late summer, hundreds of seal gather on beaches and wallow in muddy pools of water. They lie close to gather while they gradually shed patches of hair and skin. Eventually, the old skin replaced by a new coat of sleek fur, and the seal return to water. 
Mating is preceded by fights between males, who throw their huge bulk against each other. Winners get to mate with females.
Elephant seals dive to 1550 metres beneath the ocean's surface: the deepest recorded dive of an Elephant seal is . The average length of their dives is around 20 min for females and 60 min (1 hour) for males, as they search for their favorite food. Their diet includes skates, rays, squid, octopus, eels, penguin (Southerns only), and small sharks. Their stomachs also often contain gastroliths (stomach stones). 
They are surprisingly good on land, faster than humans when moving over sand dunes.

James Thomas Humberstone

James Thomas Humberstone (July 8, 1850 - June 12, 1939) was an English chemical engineer. In 1872, he founded the Peru Nitrate Company in the Tarapacá Province of Peru (now part of the Tarapacá Region of Chile). He introduced the Schanks System and other innovations to the industry.
Humberstone was born in Dover, England. His grandfather had been director of the band of the Scottish Guard. His father worked in a post office. 
His family moved to London when he was young. Humberstone worked for the London and North Western railway when he was 17. While he worked there, he learned about mechanics and chemistry. Later, he joined the Royal School of Mines in London. He was a very good student.
When he was 25, he was hired by The Tarapaca Nitrate Company and moved to South America. Humberstone arrived at the Peruvian port of Pisagua on January 6, 1875, where he commenced working as a chemist and engineer.
In 1878 he implemented the Shanks system to make sodium carbonate. He also made other changes such as the transfer of waste water to avoid losing the materials in the gravel. 
In 1879 the Chilean army landed in Pisagua, and consequently, many office workers went to the Pampa for safety. Humberstone, his wife, his mother and his two daughters went with them.
When they got to Tarapaca, the governor said they should go to Arica because the military was coming. They crossed the desert because they did not want to be near the coast. It took them twenty days to get get to Arica . When the war ended, and Tarapaca became part of Chile , Humberstone continued working in the Agua Santa office. 
In 1936, King George VI made him a member of the Order of the British Empire. Humberstone died in Iquique on June 12, 1939 and is buried in the British Cemetery, Tiliviche, Chile.

Selena

Selena Quintanilla–Pérez (April 16, 1971 – March 31, 1995), known as simply Selena, was an American singer-songwriter, actress and fashion designer. She was named the "Queen of Tejano music" and was also known as the "Mexican Madonna". Selena was born as the last child of a Mexican-American father. She released her first LP record at the age of 12 with her Selena y Los Dinos band. At the 1987 Tejano Music Awards, she won the Female Vocalist of the Year award. She won this award eight times in a row. Selena signed a record agreement with EMI Latin in 1989. She released five Spanish-language albums with them, each having chart and sales success.
"Como La Flor" became one of her signature songs after it got to number six on the US "Billboard" Hot Latin Tracks chart in 1992. The next year, "Selena Live!" won a Grammy Award for Best Mexican/American Album. In 1994, "Amor Prohibido" was released and five of the singles became number one hits. Selena became the first Hispanic singer to do this. The album became the fastest-selling Latin album of all time. "Amor Prohibido" and the song of the same name were nominated for a Grammy Award. In late 1994, Charles Koppelman, the chairman of EMI Latin, believed that Selena was ready to release a cross over album. Selena would then begin recording songs in English instead of Spanish, which would expand her career.
On 31 March 1995, Selena was killed by Yolanda Saldívar, a friend and former manager of her clothing stores. Selena's death affected people in Hispanic communities. Many candlelight vigils took place, as well as other memorials from fans. Two weeks later, Governor of Texas at the time, George W. Bush, made 16 April "Selena Day" in Texas. Her crossover album "Dreaming of You", which was not finished, was released on 18 July 1995. In 1997, Warner Bros. released a movie about her life. Puerto Rican actress Jennifer Lopez played the role of "Selena" in the movie. The role helped Lopez become famous.
In 2005, a tribute concert called "Selena ¡VIVE!" premiered on Univision. The show had the highest ratings in the channel's history. It was also the most-watched Spanish-language show in the history of American television. It was watched by more than 37 million people in the United States. In 2006, a Selena museum was built in Q-Productions. Mirador de la Flor, a bronze life-sized statue, was created in memory of Selena. These memorials are in Corpus Christi, Texas. The statue is visited by hundreds of fans every week. As of 2012, Selena has sold over 60 million albums worldwide.
Selena Quintanilla was born on Easter Day 16 April 1971 in Lake Jackson, Texas. Her mother, Marcella Ofelia Samora, is half Mexican American and half Cherokee Native American, while her father, Abraham Quintanilla Jr, is Mexican-American. Selena was raised as a Jehovah's Witness.
Abraham was a musician, but he abandoned his musical ambitions to support his family. Selena began singing along with Abraham's guitar pickin'.
Abraham organized his children into a band called "Selena y Los Dinos" ("Selena and the Boys"). 'Dinos' is an Italian slang word.
In 1982, Abrahm opened a Mexican restaurant called "PapaGayos" (). However, the restaurant closed because of the recession of 1982. The family declared bankruptcy, and were evicted (forced to move from their home). They settled in Corpus Christi, Texas. Abraham asked people in town to hire Selena y Los Dinos. They needed money and played wherever they could get a gig. They performed at street corners, weddings, quinceañeras and fairs.
In 1984, Selena recorded her first LP record for Freddie Records. Selena learned Spanish by listening to others speak. The album was not sold in stores. Freddie Records did not believe a female singer could sell a record. Her father bought all of the original copies.
Selena was bullied in school by other girls. When Selena was in the eighth grade, her father took her out of school. Her performance schedule was getting bigger. Which was too hard for Selena to stay in public school. She completed and mailed homework on her tour bus. When she was 17, she earned a high school diploma from The American School of Correspondence in Chicago. She was also accepted at Louisiana State University.
In 1985, Selena recorded her second LP record, "The New Girl in Town"; The album was not sold in stores because of copyright problems. Selena became a music guest on the "Johnny Canales Show". She sang "Oh Mama" from her second LP. In 1986, she released "Alpha". The album became her first LP to be released successfully. It helped her to be discovered by Rick Trevi, the founder for the Tejano Music Awards. Selena won the Female Vocalist of the Year award in 1987. She won every year for eight years after that. She also released two more LPs: "And the Winner Is..." and "Muñequito de Trapo".
In 1989, Selena signed a record agreement with EMI Latin. She became the first artist to sign with them. She also made Tejano music popular among younger people. Jose Behar said that he signed Selena because he thought he found the next Gloria Estefan. In the same year, Coca-Cola wanted Selena to become one of their spokespeople in Texas. Behar and Stephen Finfer asked EMI to begin Selena's cross over album. However, EMI did not want to start the crossover, while telling Selena that she needed a bigger fan base. She released her first album that same year. The lead single "Contigo Quiero Estar" got to number eight on the US "Billboard" Hot Latin Tracks chart in 1989.
In the same year, Chris Pérez, who was a rock guitarist, was asked to join Selena y Los Dinos. Abraham did not like Pérez because of his image and believed he would be a bad influence on his children. Selena's brother tried to tell Abraham that Pérez would change. Abraham agreed, because they were missing a guitarist. In 1990, Selena released "Ven Conmigo". The album became the first album by a Tejano singer to reach gold status. Around this time, Pérez and Selena fell in love with each other. Abraham was angry about this and fired Pérez from the band. Selena was warned never to see him again by her father. The two eloped on 2 April 1992. Abraham accepted the relationship and Pérez into the family. He later said that he felt guilty. He said this because he thought that it was his behavior that Selena and Pérez eloped.
A registered nurse and fan named Yolanda Saldívar asked Selena's father to start a fan club in San Antonio, Texas. Saldívar had the idea after she had attended one of Selena's concerts. Abraham approved Saldívar's request. Abraham believed the fan club would bring in new fans. Saldívar soon became a close friend to Selena and the family. She was trusted and became the president of the fan club. In 1992, Selena released "Entre a Mi Mundo". The song "Como La Flor" became Selena's signature song. The album and the single helped her to tour in Mexico. Selena recorded a duet with Salvadoran singer Alvaro Torres called "Buenos Amigos" in 1991. The song got to number one on the Hot Latin Tracks. This became Selena's first number one song. Because of this, Selena was asked to perform "Buenos Amigos" in El Salvador.
In 1993, Selena released "Selena Live!". The album won a Grammy Award for Best Mexican/American Album. Around this time, Selena opened two clothing stores called Selena Etc. She hired Saldívar as the manger. "Hispanic Business" magazine wrote that Selena earned $5 million from her clothing stores. Selena also acted in a Spanish soap opera called "Dos Mujeres, Un Camino" in 1993. When her episode premiered, it had a record rating. In December 1993, Selena was signed with SBK Records to begin her cross over album. However, recording would not begin until late-1994.
In 1994, Selena released "Amor Prohibido". The album became the best-selling Latin album of all time. Five singles from the album reached number one on the Hot Latin Tracks chart. Selena was the first Hispanic artist to do this. The album was certified double platinum by the end of the year. She also won awards from Premio Lo Nuestro including Best Latin Artist and Song of the Year. Selena recorded a duet with the Barrio Boyzz called "Donde Quiera Que Estes". The song got to number one on the Hot Latin Tracks. This allowed Selena to tour in New York City, Argentina, Puerto Rico and Central America, where she was not well known. The album and the single of the same name were nominated for a Grammy Award. "Amor Prohibido" and "No Me Queda Mas" became the most successful singles of 1994 and 1995 on the Hot Latin Track charts, according to "Billboard" and Nielson SoundScan. She was then called the "Queen of Tejano music".
In late 1994, EMI chairman Charles Koppelman felt that Selena had succeed her goals in the Spanish market. He wanted to release a cross over album with Selena. Grammy Award-winning composers began writing songs for her to record. Her goal was to become a pop icon like Donna Summer, Paula Abdul, Madonna and Mariah Carey. Selena continued on her Amor Prohibido Tour while EMI Latin prepared the album. In 1995, Selena made a cameo in "Don Juan DeMarco", which starred Marlon Brando, Johnny Depp and Faye Dunaway. In February 1995, Selena performed at the Houston Astrodome. She performed for a record-breaking audience of over 60,000 fans. This was more than country singers such as George Strait, Vince Gill, Clint Black and Reba McEntire. Meanwhile, she was planning to open two more clothing stores. One was scheduled to be opened in Monterrey, Mexico.
Selena visited local schools to talk to students about the importance of education. She spent her free time helping her community. She also worked with D.A.R.E.. She planned a fundraising concert to help AIDS patients. Selena also helped victims in Florida after Hurricane Andrew made landfall there in 1992.
According to the A&E television series "Biography", Selena's fans were minorities in the world. She encouraged them to be the best they can be. Her biggest fear was that no one would come watch her perform. At her peak, she continued to ask her father if anybody had showed up.
Selena was called the "Mexican Madonna", but unlike Madonna, Selena valued family and never cursed. She also was known for her "sexy stage costumes" that she wore while performing. Her friends and family called her a daredevil.
Saldívar was an employee and manager for Selena's clothing stores and fan club. Saldívar was stealing money from these businesses and was eventually caught. Selena did not believe that her best friend could do something like that. She tried to maintain their friendship, but by March 1995, it began to get worse. Selena and her husband Pérez visited Saldívar on 30 March 1995 to get the documents that she had stolen. Saldívar did not give Selena all the documents. On the morning of 31 March 1995, Selena met up with Saldívar to collect paperwork and missing documents for tax preparations. At the hotel, Selena demanded that Saldívar give her the missing financial papers. Saldívar then claimed that she was raped in Mexico. Selena took her to a local hospital where doctors found that Saldívar was lying. This made Selena decide to end her friendship with Saldívar. When they returned to the hotel, they began arguing even more.
When Selena turned to leave, Saldívar took a gun from her purse. She pointed it at Selena and pulled the trigger, shooting Selena in the back. Selena ran to the hotel lobby for help. She was seen holding her chest screaming repeatedly, "Help me!, I've been shot!". Saldívar chased her and called her a "bitch". Selena fell to the floor and named Saldívar as the shooter. By the time Selena arrived at a local hospital, she was pronounced dead. She was two weeks away from her 24th birthday and three days from her third wedding anniversary with Pérez. Saldívar went to her pickup truck and threatened to commit suicide. The SWAT and the FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit were called. She surrendered after nine hours.
Saldívar pleaded not guilty. She said that the shooting was an accident. She said that she meant to shoot herself, not Selena. But prosecutor Carlos Valdez pointed out that Saldivar, a former nurse, did not call 911 or attempt to help Selena after she was shot. The jury sentenced Saldívar to life imprisonment. She has the right for parole in 2025. Reactions to Selena's death were compared to reactions to Elvis Presley and John Lennon's deaths. George W. Bush, Governor of Texas at the time, declared 16 April as "Selena Day" in Texas. Selena's death was called "Black Friday" in Texas. Most White Texans were offended that Selena Day would be celebrated on Easter. Many of them also wrote to the "Brazosport Facts" that "Easter is "more" important than Selena Day". Mexican Americans in Texas wrote negative replies to the comments that were made. One Mexican American wrote that some comments made were "rude". Radio host Howard Stern mocked Selena's funeral and death. Many fans disapproved of such actions and held public boycotts.
In 1997, Warner Bros. released a movie about Selena's life. Jennifer Lopez played Selena. The role helped Lopez become famous. Music critic David Bauder believed that if Selena were alive, she would have broken the record sales of Madonna, Gloria Estefan, Paula Abdul and Whitney Houston. By 1996, Selena held the record for more wins at the Latin Music Awards than any other artist. In 2006, a Selena museum was built in Q-Productions. Mirador de la Flor, a bronze life-sized statue, was created in memory of Selena. These memorials are in Corpus Christi, Texas.
The Guinness Book of World Records named Selena as the "most dominating artist". Selena also became the first Hispanic singer to have an album sung mostly in Spanish to reach number one. She also became the first female to place five albums at the same time on the "Billboard" 200 chart. The only other artists to have done this were Elvis Presley, The Beatles and Garth Brooks. "Billboard" wrote that the release of "Dreaming of You" was "a historic day in Latin music history". The album helped Selena to become the second-fastest selling female artist that year, behind Janet Jackson. "Dreaming of You" became the second-highest debut that year, behind Michael Jackson.
"People" magazine released a tribute issue for Selena. It sold one million copies in one day. This was the only issue to have been sold out in stores across the United States. The company released three more runs, and all sold out in two weeks. This made the company to release "People En Espanol". A musical called "Selena Forever", starring Veronica Vasquez as "Selena", opened in Los Angeles. The American Bank Center in Corpus Christi renamed its 2,526-seat "Bayfront Auditorium" to "Selena Auditorium".
A tribute concert, "Selena ¡VIVE!", premiered on Univision on 7 April 2005. The concert marked the 10th anniversary of Selena's murder. The show included other Latin artists performing covers of Selena's songs. The show was the highest rated and most-watched Spanish-language show in American television history. The show had about 37 million viewers, more than the number of viewers of that night's episode of "American Idol". The show had the highest ratings in Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and New York City.
Selena's fan base continues to stay strong. Selena is considered one of the most widely known Mexican-American artists and the most popular Latin artist in the United States. Documentaries are shown on Spanish-language television annually marking Selena's death anniversary. "Billboard" named Selena the "Best Selling Latin Artist of the [1990's] Decade" and "Top Latin Artist of the 90's". As of 2012, Selena has sold over 60 million albums worldwide.

Salomon Wininger

Salomon Wininger (13 December 1877, Gura Humora, Bukovina – December 1968, in Ramat Gan, Israel) was an Austrian-Jewish biographer.
Before World War I, Wininger lived in Chernivtsi and moved to Vienna during the war years, where he decided to write biographies of famous Jewish persons. This idea was pushed in order to counter the self-hating mood of Jewish youth in the city, created under the influence of Otto Weininger's works.
After his return to Chernivtsi in 1921, Shlomo Wininger wrote about 13,000 biographies and published them in seven volumes between 1925 and 1936. He survived the time of World War II in Chernivtsi and emigrated in 1951 to Israel.
Wininger is considered as one of the greatest Jewish biographers of all time.

Indo-Canadians

Indo-Canadians are Canadians whose family can trace back to India. The names "East Indian" and "South Asian" are used for people who originate from India, to tell them apart from the First Nations peoples of Canada who are often called Indian, and from the people of the Caribbean, who are sometimes called West Indian. Most Indo-Canadians call themselves "Indian", instead of "East Indian". This is because Christopher Columbus thought the Americas were India, and that Native Americans were Indian.
Most Indo-Canadians come from India, but some come from the Caribbean, South America, Africa, and the Middle East. They usually live in cities like Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Calgary, and Vancouver. They are one of the fastest growing races in Canada, because of immigration.

Gestalt therapy

Gestalt therapy is a form of psychotherapy. It is a way of treating people who feel ill at ease. It is based on the idea that it is best to experience what we feel "here and now" and not keep thinking about the past or worry about the future. The goal is to help clients become aware of his or her thoughts, behaviours, experiences, and feelings and to "own" or take responsibility for them. 
It forms part of what is called humanistic psychology and was co-founded by Fritz Perls, Laura Perls and Paul Goodman in the 1940s-1950s. 
At the center of Gestalt therapy is the idea of "awareness" (knowing). The person being helped is encouraged to know his or her own feelings and behaviour, and the effect they have upon the world around them. 
With Gestalt therapy, the patient is helped to see that they are trying to avoid feeling emotions from the present. Once the patient realizes this, he or she can begin to get better.

<doc id="224739" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=224739" title="Special education">
Special education

Some children are disabled, or they have learning difficulties. Special education is about teaching these children. Some of them can be educated with other children of the same age who are not disabled. Others must go to special schools. If the disability is too bad they can not get an education. Students who have emotional problems and act poorly are sometimes expelled from school. Inclusive education is afirmed by the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to reduce such exclusion.
Special needs include speech or hearing difficulties, emotional and behavioral disorders, physical disabilities, and developmental disorders. Students with these special needs often get more educational services. This may mean different approaches to teaching, access to a resource room and use of technology.
Some students are very smart. These students are called gifted. They also have certain needs so they can succeed. These students do better with special teaching styles or different educational programs. The word 'special education' is used for students whose special needs stop them from learning the way normal people learn. Gifted education is handled separately.
Schools provide special education services to special students. 
Most schools around the world use inclusion, which means children with special needs, need to earn their right to be in the regular classroom. Sometimes schools may use full inclusion for certain students such as those with mental retardation. In that case, this is where social tolerance is afforded rather than if these students actually do earn their right to be in regular classroom. Sometimes mainstreaming is used, this is when children with special needs are in regular classroom settings as much as possible and put in special classes for the rest of the day. Social integration is used for students with special needs who are in a resource room or other special class for the rest of the time.
Historically, most students with special needs have been excluded from school, and such exclusion may still occur where there is no legal mandate for special education services, such as in developing countries.

The taxonomy and systematics of the Sooty Barbthroat complex has made much confusion. Some authors thought the Sooty Barbthroat to be a "melanistic variant" of the Pale-tailed Barbthroat ("T. leucurus").
Not only that, but some suggest that the Bronze-tailed Barbthroat ("T. n. loehkeni") should also be thought a valid species and have the doubtful Christina's Barbthroat ("T. n. christinae") as a subspecies. Freire's Sooty Barbthroat (T. n. freirei) is average between the Sooty and Bronze-tailed Barbthroats however, and thus its status needs to be more clear before the problem is fixed.

Earmuffs

Earmuffs are that are made to cover and protect a person's ears. A plastic or metal band fits over the top of the head, and there are two pads at the ends that cover the ears warmly.
Chester Greenwood invented the earmuffs when he was 15. His ears would turn into unusual colors like red, white, purple, or blue and begin to hurt when it was cold (he lived in Maine). Because of this, he could not try the new ice skates he got for his fifteenth birthday. Chester had tried wrapping a scarf around his head, but it was too bulky. So Chester twisted some wire so that it went across the top of his head, and made a loop on each end near his ears. Then he asked his grandmother to sew some material on the end of each loop. She put black velvet on the inside of the ears, and beaver fur on the outside of each loop, then sewed the wire across Chester's hat to make it stay.Soon lots of people in his town wanted ear warmers like Chester's, and he opened a factory when he was 19 to make them. Each year, his home town (Farmington) celebrates his invention with a parade on "Chester Greenwood Day." 
There are two kinds of earmuffs: "thermal earmuffs", which keep a person's ears warm, and "acoustic earmuffs", also called "ear defenders", which block out a lot of sound and noise and can be used in construction (building) sites, for example, when jackhammering.

Rigel is a hot supergiant star in the Milky Way Galaxy. It is classified as a blue supergiant. It is located in the constellation Orion. Many scientists believe that Rigel was the youngest star even if it is the same size with the biggest star, Betelgeuse. Rigel is much bigger than our star here in the solar system, the Sun. Rigel lies 778 light-years from Earth in Orion. It is visible from Earth as a small, bluish circle on clear nights from both hemispheres. 
The color of this star is bluish-white, hotter than a star with a yellow color, meaning it will use more energy quickly. The Sun runs off the same gases as Rigel; hydrogen and helium that makes it shine. When Rigel loses its fuel inside the very hot core, it will blow up into the red supergiant stage of its life and explode in a supernova. A black hole or a pulsar could be left.

Cathode ray

A cathode ray is a stream of electrons that are seen in vacuum tubes. It is called a "cathode ray" because the electrons are being emitted from the positive charged element in the vacuum tube called the cathode. A cathode ray tube aims the ray at a point on its screen. They were first observed in 1869 by German physicist Johann Hittorf, and were named in 1876 by Eugen Goldstein "Kathodenstrahlen", or cathode rays.
Electrons were discovered as the constituents of cathode rays in 1897 by British physicist J. J. Thomson. He showed the rays were composed of a previously unknown negatively charged particle, which was later called the "electron". Cathode ray tubes (CRTs) use a focused beam of electrons deflected by electric or magnetic fields to create the image in a classic television set.

In the philosophy of consciousness, "sentience" can refer to the ability of any thing to have subjective perceptual experiences, or as some philosophers refer to them, "qualia".
Thinking about sentience is important when studying animal rights. This is because feeling is needed in order to suffer. The basis of animal rights is that some animals have emotions, can feel pain and also feel happy and well.

Mansfield, Victoria

Mansfield is a small town at the base of the Victorian part of the Australian Alps. It is about north-east of Melbourne. In 2006 there were 4052 people living in Mansfield.
Mansfield is the centre of a large shire; it was made to join with the nearby town of Benalla away, to form Delatite Shire. Many people did not like this change and Mansfield became the first de-amalgamation in Victoria. Mansfield was once mainly a farming and logging town, but is now a tourist-centre. It is the support town for the large Australia ski resort Mt Buller. It is well known for the High Country tradition of alpine grazing, made famous in the movie "The Man from Snowy River". This was made around Mansfield, based on the poem by Banjo Paterson.
Mansfield, first known as Mount Battery, was at the boundary of a number of pastoral runs (very large farms). A township was surveyed in 1851 and named after Mansfield in Nottinghamshire, England. People came to live in the town after the discovery of gold nearby and the Post Office opened on January 1, 1858.
The Mansfield railway line, reached the town from Tallarook in 1891, and was closed on November 18, 1978. The last passenger train was on May 28, 1977.
The area round Mansfield named as "Banbury" was also the location of the novel "The Far Country" by Nevil Shute. It was about logging on Mount Buller and previous forest fires, which having burnt through Howqua, removed almost all evidence of an older settlement.
Dr. John Pearson Rowe (1810–1878) was a physician and squatter (farmer) who owned the 'Loyola Run' (also known as Mt Battery) near Mansfield. He is said to be the first catholic person to live in the district. It is recorded that the nearby town of Rochester was named after J.P.Rowe, as he owned land on the Campaspe River. Rowe was a principal founder of the University of Melbourne. He fired a shot at a 14 year old bushranger, Ned Kelly and Harry Power on 27 May 1869. Rowe stood for parliament, in the Upper House seat of the Murray District in 1859 and was defeated. In October 1878, Rowe gave information to police Sergeant Kennedy about where Ned Kelly was hiding. Using Rowe's information, Kennedy and three other policemen rode into the Wombat Ranges to find him. Three of them were killed at Stringybark Creeka, and the Kelly Gang was born.
Mansfield is very close to two large lakes, Lake Eildon and Lake Nillahcootie. During the summer many people go to the lakes to water ski.
The nearby mountains, Mount Buller and Mount Stirling offer attractions all year round. During winter they are visited for skiing, both downhill skiing and cross country skiing. In the summer hiking and mountain biking are popular. Ski lifts work year-round at Mount Buller which help bike riders to easily get to the top of downhill mountain biking runs.
The bush around Mansfield is used for horse riding, trail biking and four wheel driving on the many tracks throughout the region.
In past years, the "Mansfield Balloon Festival" celebrated hot air balloons, and many people came from from across the state. The Balloon Festival has not been held in Mansfield for several years.
Mansfield has a football team, the Mansfield Eagles, an Australian Rules team which plays in the Goulburn Valley Football League.
Mansfield has a horse racing club, the Mansfield District Racing Club, which holds two race meetings a year in November and December.
Golfers play at the Mansfield Golf Club on Kidston Parade.

Airbus A330

The Airbus A330 is a two engine, wide-body passenger aeroplane made by Airbus. It was designed at the same time as the Airbus A340, so it has the same body and wings.
It first flew in 1992 and the first one was delivered to Air Inter in 1994. It was a 300 series. Just after this, Airbus made the shorter 200 series. Now, Airbus has made a freighter version and a tanker version (which carries additional fuel so it can give some to other planes). 
There are also 394 A330s that need to be made and given to airlines. Most of these are the smaller 200 series version.
Airlines wanted a new aeroplane to replace their McDonnell Douglas DC-10 aeroplanes which were getting old. So, Airbus started a new project in November 1987: the A330 and A340 programs. In the end, it was found that the A330 is almost 38% more fuel efficient than the DC-10.
Airbus designed the A330 to be in the market for ETOPS aeroplanes. This market already had planes like the Boeing 767. In November 2009, the A330 was the first aeroplane to get the ETOPS-240 approval, which means that the plane is allowed to fly up to 240 minutes away from any airport. This means it can fly over large oceans or places like the Antarctic where there are no airports nearby. 
The A330's body and wings are nearly exactly the same as the smaller versions of the A340's wings and body, but they have different engines. The A330's body is also similar to the older Airbus A300, and the computers and systems (like the fly-by-wire system) are similar to the Airbus A320 family of aeroplanes. Also, both the A330 and A340 are built at the same place: Toulouse-Blagnac Airport in Toulouse in France.
The 1000th A330 was ordered at the 2008 Farnborough Air Show by Cathay Pacific.
Airbus thinks that it will keep building the A330 until at least 2015.
There are two main types of Airbus A330: the 200 series and the 300 series. There is also the freighter version, which carries cargo instead of people, and the tanker version which carries lots of fuel (usually to give to other planes).
The A330-200 was made to compete with Boeing's 767-300ER. It is a shorter version of the A330-300 and is like the A340-200.
In the 1990s, Airbus was not selling very many A340-200s (only 28 were built). So, Airbus used the body of the A340-200 and took the wings and engines of the A330-300. This made the plane much more efficient and the A330-200 was much more popular than the A340-200.
The tail fin (called the rudder) of the A330-200 is a little bit taller than the 300 version to produce the same torque as the A330-300.
It has the same MTOW (Maximum Take-Off Weight) as the A330-300, so it can take more fuel than the A330-300. This means the A330-200 can fly further than the A330-300. It has a range of 12,500 km which is the same as 6,750 nmi.
The A330 has three engine choices for airlines to choose from: two General Electric CF6-80E engines, two Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines or two Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines.
In May 2009, Airbus said they have plans to make a version of the A330-200 that can take off with a higher weight. This is because they want to compete with Boeing and their 787-8 aircraft.
It will have a new MTOW of 238 tonnes and a new range of 13,300 km which is 7,200 nmi. Airbus thinks that the 787-8 will have a range of 6,720 nmi (12,450 km) which is about 1000 nmi (1,900 km) less than what Boeing said it would be.
Korean Air will be the first airline to have the A330-200HGW. It ordered the aeroplanes on 27 February 2009 and will get the first one in 2010.
Because the Airbus A300-600F and Airbus A310F were getting old and companies had stopped ordering them, Airbus decided to make a new freighter plane to replace them. It started offering the aeroplane around the years 2000–2001. The aeroplane was talked about again at the 2006 Farnborough Airshow. Airbus got permission to sell the plane in January 2007 and the first plane came out of the factory on 20 October 2009. The aircraft first flew on 5 November 2009.
It can fly 64 tonnes of cargo over 4,000 nmi (7,400 km) or 69 tonnes over 3,200 nmi (5,930 km). The aeroplane was designed to use a new loading system that can use two different ways of holding cargo: containers or pallets (either smaller side by side pallets or larger single row pallets). 
It has a new front landing gear system. Normally the A330-200 points slightly downwards when it is on the ground. This is good because the pilots can see the ground better but it makes loading the cargo harder. With this new gear, the aircraft sits straight so it is easier to load the cargo. It works by making the point where the plane attaches to the gear lower. This means that the nose has a bubble on the bottom to make sure the gear fits properly.
Airbus has 67 orders for the A330-200F. The customer who ordered the most planes is Intrepid Aviation Group who have ordered 20.
This version is a tanker aircraft, which means that it carries a lot of jet fuel to give to other planes. It also has a few seats so that it can be used to carry passengers. It is used by the military.
The plane has been ordered by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), the UK's Royal Air Force (RAF), the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.
The plane was also offered to the U.S. Air Force as a replacement for some of their Boeing KC-135 'Stratotankers'. Eventually in 2002, they chose Boeing's offering: the KC-767. But this order was cancelled after a lot of political controversy. In 2006, the Air Force started again. Boeing again offered the KC-767 and Airbus teamed up with Northrop Grumman to make the KC-30. This time, they chose the KC-30 and renamed it the KC-45A. But Boeing complained that the ruling was not fair and the US Government Accountability Office agreed with Boeing. The bid was cancelled again. Northrop Grumman has decided not to offer the KC-45A again.
The A330-300 started working in 1993.It was the first type of A330. It competes with Boeing's 777-200 and 767-400ER. It was made as a replacement for the Airbus A300. It has a similar body to the A300-600, but it has new wings and systems.
It carries 295 passengers in three classes or 335 in two classes or 440 in one class. It can fly up to 5,650 nmi (10,500 km).
It has either two General Electric CF6-80E engines, two Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines or two Rolls Royce Trent 700 engines. All the engines are ETOPS rated at ETOPS-180 which means that the A330-300 can fly up to 180 minutes away from an airport that it can land at.
80 airlines or companies currently use the A330. The ones with the most A330s are Cathay Pacific from Hong Kong who have 32, Delta Air Lines from the United States of America who have 32, Emirates Airline from the United Arab Emirates who have 29, Qatar Airways from Qatar who have 29 and Air China and China Eastern Airlines who are both in China and have 20 each.
The A330 has had ten accidents: two hull-loss accidents (crashes where the plane cannot be fixed and cannot be used any more). There has been a total of 235 fatalities in the accidents.

Germination

Germination occurs when a spore or seed starts to grow. It is a term used in botany. When a spore or seed germinates, it produces a shoot or seedling, or (in the case of fungi) a hypha. The biology of spores is different from seeds. 
A "spore" germinates if and when conditions are right. It has a very limited lifespan. The method of spore-bearers, which are lower plants such as mosses, ferns and also fungi, is to produce vast numbers of spores, of which only a small percentage germinate.
"Seeds" contain an embryo, a store of food (the endosperm), and a protective coat. Seed plants include Gymnosperms (such as conifers) and Angiosperms (such as flowering plants). Seeds can survive much longer than spores, sometimes for hundreds of years. The strategy of seed-bearing plants is to invest energy and material in the substance of seeds, and they have evolved more sophisticated methods of dispersal than just wind.
Seeds do not germinate until their requirements are met, and these needs differ from species to species.
The requirements for fruits is the same as for seeds. A fruit is just a seed with one or more extra layers derived from parts of the flower.

<doc id="224952" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=224952" title="Fractal">
Fractal

A fractal is any pattern, that when seen as an image, produces a picture, which when zoomed into will still make the same picture. It can be cut into parts which look like a smaller version of the picture that was started with. The word "fractal" was made by Benoît Mandelbrot in 1975 from the Latin word "fractus", which means "broken" or "fractured". A simple example is a tree that branches into smaller branches, and those branches into smaller branches and so on. Fractals are not only beautiful, but also have many practical applications.
There are many types of fractals, made in a large variety of ways. One example is the Sierpinski triangle, where there are an infinite number of small triangles inside the large one. Another example is the Mandelbrot set, named for Benoît Mandelbrot. The Sierpinksi triangle is constructed using patterns, but the Mandelbrot set is based on an equation.
There are also many natural examples of fractals in nature including trees, snowflakes, some vegetables and coastlines.
The Koch Curve is a simple example of a fractal. First, start with part of a straight line - called a straight line segment. Cut the line into 3 same-sized pieces. Get rid of the middle of those pieces, and put in the top part of a triangle with sides which are the same length as the bit to cut out. We now have 4 line segments which are touching at the ends. We can now do what we just did to the first segment to each of the 4 bits. We can now do the same thing again and again to all the bits we end up with. We now do this forever and look at what we end up with.
The length of the Koch Curve is infinity, and the area of the Koch Curve is zero. This is quite strange. A line segment (with dimension 1) could have a length of 1, but it has an area of 0. A square of length 1 and width 1 (with dimension 2) will have area 1 and length of infinity.
So, the Koch Curve seems to be bigger than something of dimension 1, and smaller than something of dimension 2. The idea of the similarity dimension is to give a dimension which gives a better idea of length or area for fractals. So, for a Koch Curve, we want a dimension between 1 and 2.
The Koch Curve can be cut into 4 pieces, each of which are formula_1 of the size of the original. We call the number of pieces that a fractal can be cut into formula_2, and we call the size difference formula_3. We put those into the equation:
formula_4
Where formula_5 is the logarithm of a number. This number is the Hausdorff Dimension of the fractal. In the Koch Curve, this is formula_6 as we wanted.
The Koch Curve is one of the simplest fractal shapes, and so its dimension is easy to work out. Its similarity dimension and Hausdorff dimension are both the same. This is not true for more complex fractals.
The Koch snowflake (or Koch star) is the same as the Koch curve, except it starts with an equilateral triangle instead of a line segment.
Fractals have many applications e.g. in biology (lung, kidneys, heart rate variability, etc...), in earthquakes, in finance where it is related to the so called heavy tail distributions and in physics. This indicates that fractals should be studied to understand why fractals are so frequent in nature.
Some fractals exist only for artistic reasons, but others are very useful. Fractals are very efficient shapes for radio antennas and are used in computer chips to efficiently connect all the components. Also, coastlines can be thought of as fractals.

The Staatskapelle Berlin is a German orchestra. It is the orchestra of the Berlin State Opera (Berliner Staatsoper Unter den Linden).
The history of the orchestra goes back to 1570, when the Elector of Brandenburg started an orchestra at his court. By the mid 18th century it was linked to the Royal Court Opera, started in 1742 by Frederick the Great. Famous musicians who have played with the orchestra include Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, Franz Benda, and Johann Joachim Quantz
Giacomo Meyerbeer became "Kapellmeister" (Music Director), from 1842. The orchestra started a series of public concerts. They were the first orchestra to play the first performances of many famous pieces of music by Richard Wagner, Felix Mendelssohn, and Otto Nicolai. 
The orchestra's music director is called the "Staatskapellmeister". He is also the music director of the Berlin State Opera. Today the music director is Daniel Barenboim, who has had the job since 1992. In 2000 Barenboim was given the title of "conductor for life". Barenboim and the orchestra have made several recordings.

Berlin State Opera

The Berlin State Opera, known in Germany as Staatsoper Unter den Linden is a world famous German opera company. Its permanent home is the Opera House on the Unter den Linden boulevard in Berlin.
The opera house was opened on 7 December 1742. It was the beginning of a 250-year co-operation between the Staatsoper and the orchestra called Berlin Staatskapelle. Famous conductors and composers associated with the opera house include Gaspare Spontini, Giacomo Meyerbeer and Richard Strauss.
On 18 August 1843 the Linden Opera was destroyed by fire. The new building was built a year later. It was called Königliches Opernhaus (Royal Opera House), and it opened with a performance of Meyerbeer's "Ein Feldlager in Schlesien".
In 1821, the Berlin Opera gave the first performance of Weber's "Der Freischütz". In 1849, it gave the first performance of Otto Nicolai's "The Merry Wives of Windsor", conducted by the composer himself.
At the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the Royal Court Opera, Berlin, had many famous conductors. They included Felix von Weingartner, Karl Muck, Richard Strauss, and Leo Blech.
After the collapse of the German Empire in 1918, the Opera was renamed "Staatsoper unter den Linden" and the "Königliche Kapelle" became "Kapelle der Staatsoper".
In the 1920s, Wilhelm Furtwängler, Erich Kleiber, Otto Klemperer, Alexander von Zemlinsky, Bruno Walter 
conducted. In 1925, Alban Berg's "Wozzeck", was given its first performance conducted by Erich Kleiber with the composer in the audience.
After having had many repairs and improvements, the Linden Opera reopened in April 1928 with a new production of "Die Zauberflöte". In the same year, the famous Russian bass Feodor Chaliapin and Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes with conductor Ernest Ansermet were guest performers. In 1930 Erich Kleiber conducted the first performance of Darius Milhaud's "Christoph Columbus".
In 1934, when symphonic pieces from Alban Berg's "Lulu" were performed by Kleiber, the Nazis created a scandal and Kleiber had to go into exile.
When Hitler came to power all the Jews in the orchestra had to leave. Many went into exile, including the conductors Otto Klemperer and Fritz Busch. During the Third Reich, Robert Heger, Herbert von Karajan (1939-1945) and Johannes Schüler were the "Staatskapellmeister". 
In 1945 The Lindenoper was once again destroyed on 3 February. The second rebuilding took a long time. From 1945, the opera company played in the former "Admiralspalast" (today's Metropoltheater). From 1949, the company served as state opera of the GDR. It moved back to its original home after the rebuilding in 1955. The newly rebuilt opera house was opened, again, with Wagner's "Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg".
After the Berlin Wall was built in 1961, the Opera continued to perform music from the classical and romantic periods together with contemporary ballet and operas.
After the Germany Reunification, the Linden Opera had links again with the operatic world. In the 1990s, the opera was officially renamed "Staatsoper Unter den Linden".
In 1992, the Argentine-Israeli conductor Daniel Barenboim was appointed Music Director. In 2000, the orchestra (according to its official website) gave Barenboim the title "conductor for life." During the 2002 "Festtage", he led a Wagner cycle in ten parts.

Vascular dementia is the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. It is a type of dementia caused by problems in the supply of blood to the brain.
Brain cells need a good supply of blood to stay healthy and function properly. The blood is delivered through a network of blood vessels called the vascular system. If the vascular system within the brain becomes damaged and blood cannot reach the brain cells, the cells will eventually die. This can lead to the onset of vascular dementia.

Resource room

Resource room is a place where special education students attend daily classes. These students are usually included in the general classroom and just need more support. Students are taught individually and in small groups. The number of students in a resource room is at most five students per teacher. Mainstreaming in education typically includes this service. Students in separate classes generally do not need the resource room because all the support they need is in the self-contained classroom.
Special education teachers in resource rooms focus on the goals set by an Individualized Education Program. These goals are based on the individual student's need to develop executive skills, complete their homework and behave. The programs can help students with language-based learning disabilities like dyslexia. Visuo-motor perception, arithmetic, spelling and overall self-perception improve after time in the resource room classroom. The small-group instructional model leads to achievement in students with a multitude of educational disabilities.
Their peers also benefit when the concepts they learned in general education are reinforced in resource rooms.

Peanut butter can protect people from cardiovascular sickness. Peanut butter (and peanuts) have lots of protein, E, magnesium, folate, food fiber, and arginine. However, some people with peanut allergies can have a shock or allergic reaction from eating or smelling it, which has made some schools decide not to let their students eat peanut butter in their schools. Some oils put inside peanut butter to make it easier to spread can also make people have heart disease. Peanut butter can also carry salmonella and make people sick because of it.

End–Ordovician extinction event

The End–Ordovician extinction event is the third-largest extinction event of the Phanerozoic eon. The Ordovician period followed the Cambrian and was followed by the Silurian. There were no living things on the land except for bacteria and perhaps some single-celled algae. The biota was almost entirely marine.
The extinction came in two steps, at the start and the finish of the "Hirnantian" stage, which was the last stage of the Ordovician. 
Basic mechanism: climate changes from very warm to very cold and back to very warm. Changes in ocean circulation were the results of the climate changes. Both benthic (ocean bottom) and pelagic fauna were faced with conditions they were unable to cope with.
More than 100 invertebrate families becam extinct in the End–Ordovician extinction event, and a total of almost half the genera. The brachiopods and bryozoans were decimated, along with many of the trilobite, conodont and graptolite families. 
The cause was probably the rise and erosion of the Appalachian Mountains. The rise put much CO into the atmosphere, and the erosion took it out.

Codeshare agreement

Codesharing is a type of partnership that airlines have. Airlines agree to sell each other's tickets on some routes. This means that both airlines sell more tickets.
Sometimes, airlines join groups (called alliances) which all agree to sell each other's tickets. For example, both United Airlines and Lufthansa are part of Star Alliance. This means that Lufthansa can sell tickets for United Airlines and United Airlines can sell Lufthansa's tickets.
Because airlines sell each other's tickets, some flights will have more than one flight number.

Pinchas Zukerman

Pinchas Zukerman (, (born July 16, 1948 in Tel Aviv) is a famous Israeli violinist, violist, and conductor. He is widely thought of as one of the world’s greatest violinists. Since 1971 he has also conducted many orchestras.
Pinchas Zukerman was born in Tel Aviv. His parents were Jews who had survived the Nazi concentration camps and had moved from Poland to Israel in 1947. By the time he was eight he showed great musical promise and started to learn music at the Academy of Music in Tel Aviv. When the violinist Isaac Stern heard him play he was so impressed that he helped him to go to the Julliard School of Music in New York. There he studied with Ivan Galanian.
In 1967 Zukerman shared a joint first prize in the Leventritt International Competition with Kyung Wha Chung. Then Stern became ill and could not play in some concerts, so Zukerman played instead. This made him very famous.
After hearing Daniel Barenboim conduct the English Chamber Orchestra he became very interested in conducting. He started to conduct orchestras while playing the solo parts of works by Bach and Vivaldi. This conducting (leading) from the concertmaster’s chair had been the tradition in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1974 he conducted the English Chamber Orchestra. Then he got opportunities to conduct New York Philharmonic, the National Symphony, Boston Symphony, and Los Angeles Philharmonic orchestras. In the 1980s he was the musical director of the St Paul Chamber Orchestra. For many years he continued to appear as soloist with some of the best orchestras in the world. He won many awards, including two Grammy Awards. 
In April 1998, he became music director of the National Arts Centre Orchestra in Ottawa. He took them on a tour of Europe in 1990.
In recent years Zukerman has worked hard to help young musicians. As music director of the National Arts Centre Orchestra, he started the Young Artists Program, a summer training program for talented young classical musicians. It soon became very popular, with students from all over the world.
Although he had a lot of work in Ottawa he also found time to be music director of the Ilona Feher Music Center in Holon, Israel, which he started. He became chairman of the Pinchas Zukerman Performance Program at the Manhattan School of Music in New York City. He was also artist in residence of the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra.
In 1968 he married Eugenia Rich. They had two daughters. Later they divorced. In 1985 he married the actress Tuesday Weld. They later divorced.

Velvet worm

The velvet worms (Onychophora — literally "claw bearers") are a minor Ecdysozoan phylum. 
There are two families and 110 living species. All living species are terrestrial, in moist or wet tropical areas. However, the phylum goes back to the Cambrian, and all the early specimens are from marine strata.
The two living families are the Peripatidae and the Peripatopsidae. They show a peculiar distribution, with the peripatids being predominantly equatorial and tropical, while the peripatopsids are all found in what used to be Gondwana.
The segmented worm-like organisms have tiny eyes, antennae, multiple pairs of legs and slime glands. The group is thought to be related to arthropods. They prey on smaller animals such as insects, which they catch by squirting a sticky slime.

Tardigrade

Tardigrades ('water bears') are the phylum Tardigrada, part of the superphylum Ecdysozoa. They are microscopic, water-dwelling, segmented animals. 
Tardigrades were first described in 1773. Their name means "slow stepper". There are more than 1000 different species of tardigrade. 
Tardigrades have a cylindrical shape with four segments, each with two legs. Each leg has little claws. The biggest adults may reach a body length of 1.2 mm, the smallest below 0.1 mm. Freshly hatched larvae may be smaller than 0.05 mm. Tardigrades feed on plant cells by penetrating the cell wall and eating what is inside. Some tardigrades are carnivores.
Tardigrades are eutelic, meaning all adult tardigrades of the same species have the same number of cells. Some species have as many as 40,000 cells in each adult, while others have far fewer.
Tardigrades can be found in many habitats: in moss, freshwater, the Himalayas, and the ocean. They are one of the few animals that can be found on the highest mountains and the deepest seas. About 83 percent of the species live on land, the other 17 percent live in water.
Tardigrades are able to live in environments that would kill most animals. In 2007, scientists discovered that some tardigrades were able to survive 10 days in outer space. Tardigrades can survive more than ten years without water. Tardigrates can survive a few hours in temperatures close to absolute zero and above boiling point.
Tardigrades can survive being frozen for over 30 years.

<doc id="225306" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=225306" title="Yellow journalism">
Yellow journalism

Yellow journalism or the yellow press is a type of journalism that does not report much real news with facts. It uses shocking headlines that catch people's attention to sell more newspapers. Yellow journalism might include exaggerating facts or spreading rumors. 
Yellow press newspapers have several columns and front-page headlines about different types of news, such as sports and scandals. They use bold layouts (with large illustrations and perhaps color), and stories reported using unnamed sources. The term was often used to talk about some large New York City newspapers around 1900 as they fought to get more readers than the other newspapers.
In 1941, Frank Mott said that there were five things that made up yellow journalism: 
The term came from the American Gilded Age of the late 1800s with two newspaper owners who fought to get more readers and sell more newspapers than the other. These were Joseph Pulitzer's and the "New York World" and William Randolph Hearst with the "New York Journal". The most important part of this fight was from 1895 to about 1898. When people talk about "yellow journalism" in history, they are often talking about these years. 
Both papers were accused of sensationalizing the news (making it seem much more important than it really was) in order to sell more newspapers, although the newspapers did serious reporting as well. The "New York Press" came up with the term "Yellow Kid journalism" in early 1897 after a then-popular comic strip, to talk about the newspapers of Pulitzer and Hearst, which both published versions of it during a circulation war. Ervin Wardman, publisher of the "New York Herald" (which was not "yellow journalism") came up with the term.
Joseph Pulitzer bought the "New York World" in 1883 after making the "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" the biggest daily newspaper in that city. Pulitzer tried to make the "New York World" fun to read, and filled his paper with pictures, games and contests that brought in new readers. Crime stories filled many of the pages, with headlines like "Was He a Suicide?" and "Screaming for Mercy." Also, Pulitzer only charged readers two cents per issue but gave readers eight and sometimes 12 pages of information (the only other two cent paper in the city was never longer than four pages).
While there were many sensational stories in the "New York World", they were by no means the only stories, or even the biggest ones. Pulitzer believed that newspapers were important and had a duty to make society better, and he tried to do this with his newspaper.
Just two years after Pulitzer took it over, the "World" sold more copies than any other newspaper in New York. Part of this was because he was connected to the Democratic Party. Older publishers, who were jealous of Pulitzer's success, began saying bad things about the "World". They talked about how he had crime stories and stunts but ignored its more serious reporting. Charles Anderson Dana|Charles Dana, editor of the "New York Sun", attacked "The World" and said Pulitzer was "deficient in judgment and in staying power."
William Randolph Hearst, a mining heir who bought the "San Francisco Examiner" from his father in 1887, noticed what Pulitzer was doing. Hearst read the "World" while studying at Harvard University. He decided to try to make the "Examiner" as bright as Pulitzer's paper. While he was in charge, the "Examiner" gave 24 percent of its space to crime, presenting the stories as morality plays, and put adultery and "nudity" (by 19th century standards) on the front page. A month after Hearst took over the paper, the "Examiner" ran this headline about a hotel fire:
HUNGRY, FRANTIC FLAMES. They Leap Madly Upon the Splendid Pleasure Palace by the Bay of Monterey, Encircling Del Monte in Their Ravenous Embrace From Pinnacle to Foundation. Leaping Higher, Higher, Higher, With Desperate Desire. Running Madly Riotous Through Cornice, Archway and Facade. Rushing in Upon the Trembling Guests with Savage Fury. Appalled and Panic-Striken the Breathless Fugitives Gaze Upon the Scene of Terror. The Magnificent Hotel and Its Rich Adornments Now a Smoldering heap of Ashes. The "Examiner" Sends a Special Train to Monterey to Gather Full Details of the Terrible Disaster. Arrival of the Unfortunate Victims on the Morning's Train — A History of Hotel del Monte — The Plans for Rebuilding the Celebrated Hostelry — Particulars and Supposed Origin of the Fire."
Hearst could be over the top in his crime coverage. One of his early stories, about a "band of murderers", attacked the police for forcing "Examiner" reporters to do their work for them. But while doing these things, the "Examiner" also increased its space for international news, and sent reporters out to uncover corruption and inefficiency in the city government. In one story, "Examiner" reporter Winifred Black went into a San Francisco hospital as a patient and discovered that the women there were treated with "gross cruelty". The entire hospital staff was fired the morning the story was printed.
With the "Examiner"' having success by the early 1890s, Hearst began looking for a New York newspaper to buy, and bought the "New York Journal" in 1895, a newspaper that sold for oen penny which Pulitzer's brother Albert had sold to a Cincinnati publisher the year before.
After noticing what Pulitzer had done by keeping his newspaper at two cents, Hearst made the "Journal's" only cost one cent, while providing as much information as rival newspapers. This worked, and as the "Journal's" had 150,000 people subscribe to it, Pulitzer cut his price to a penny, hoping to make Hearst (who was subsidized by his family's fortune) run out of money. Hearst then hired many people who were working for "World" in 1896. While most sources say that Hearst simply offered more money, Pulitzer — who had grown more abusive to his employees — had become a very difficult man to work for, and many "World" employees were willing to switch newspapers just to get away from him.
Although the competition between the "World" and the "Journal" was fierce, the newspapers had a lot in common. Both were Democratic, both took the side of organized labor and immigrants (unlike publishers like the "New York Tribune's "Whitelaw Reid, who blamed their poverty on moral defects), and both spent a lot of money making their Sunday publications, which were like weekly magazines, going beyond just daily journalism.
Their Sunday entertainment features included the first color comic strip pages, and some think that the term yellow journalism originated there, while as noted above, the "New York Press" left the term it invented undefined. "Hogan's Alley," a comic strip about a bald child in a yellow nightshirt (nicknamed The Yellow Kid), became very popular when cartoonist Richard F. Outcault began drawing it in the "World" in early 1896. When Hearst hired Outcault away, Pulitzer asked artist George Luks to continue drawing the strip with his characters, giving the city two Yellow Kids. The use of "yellow journalism" as a term for over-the-top sensationalism in the U.S. apparently started with more serious newspapers commenting how far "the Yellow Kid papers" went.
Pulitzer and Hearst are often credited (or blamed) for drawing the nation into the Spanish-American War with their sensationalism. However, most of Americans did not live in New York City, and the decision makers who did live there probably read less sensationalist newspapers like the "Times," "The Sun" or the "Post." The most famous example of the exaggeration is the story, which probably is not actually true, that artist Frederic Remington sent Hearst a telegram to tell him that not much was going on in Cuba and "There will be no war." Hearst responded "Please remain. You furnish the pictures and I'll furnish the war." The story (a version of which appears in the Hearst-inspired Orson Welles film "Citizen Kane") first showed up in the memoirs of reporter James Creelman in 1901, and there is no other source for it.
But Hearst did want the United States to go to war after a rebellion broke out in Cuba in 1895. Stories about Cubans being good people and Spain treating Cuba badly soon showed up on his front page. While the stories were probably not very accurate, the newspaper readers of the 19th century did not expect, or necessarily want, his stories to be pure nonfiction. Historian Michael Robertson has said that "Newspaper reporters and readers of the 1890s were much less concerned with distinguishing among fact-based reporting, opinion and literature."
Pulitzer, although he did not have Hearst's resources, kept the story on his front page. The yellow press published a lot about the revolution (much of which was not quite true), but conditions on Cuba were bad enough. The island was in a bad economic depression, and Spanish general Valeriano Weyler, sent to crush the rebellion, herded Cuban peasants into concentration camps leading hundreds of Cubans to their deaths. Having fought for a fight for two years, Hearst took credit for the conflict when it came: A week after the United States declared war on Spain, he ran "How do you like the "Journal's" war?" on his front page. In fact, President William McKinley never read the "Journal", and newspapers like the "Tribune" and the "New York Evening Post". Also, journalism historians have noted that yellow journalism mostly only happened in New York City, and that newspapers in the rest of the country did not do it. The "Journal" and the "World" were not among the top ten sources of news in regional papers, and their stories did not catch people's attention outside New York City. 
Hearst sailed to Cuba, when the invasion began, as a war correspondent, providing sober and accurate accounts of the fighting. Creelman later praised the work of the reporters for writing about how Spain treated Cuba, arguing, " no true history of the war . . . can be written without an acknowledgment that whatever of justice and freedom and progress was accomplished by the Spanish-American war was due to the enterprise and tenacity of "yellow journalists," many of whom lie in unremembered graves."
Hearst was a well-known Democrat who promoted William Jennings Bryan for president in 1896 and 1900 (Bryan did not win either election). He later ran for mayor and governor and even tried to get nominated for president, but his reputation was hurt in 1901 after columnist Ambrose Bierce and editor Arthur Brisbane published separate columns months apart that suggested that President William McKinley be assassinated. When McKinley was shot on September 6, 1901, critics accused Hearst's Yellow Journalism of driving Leon Czolgosz to the deed. Hearst did not know of Bierce's column and claimed to have pulled Brisbane's after it ran in a first edition, but the incident would haunt him for the rest of his life and all but destroyed his dream to be president.
Pulitzer, haunted by what had happened," returned the "World" to its crusading roots as the new century dawned. By the time of his death in 1911, the "World" was a widely-respected publication, and would remain a leading progressive paper until its demise in 1931.

Goldsmith's greatest poem, "The Deserted Village" (1770), was a sad poem about how country life was being destroyed by landowners. The same theme is inside "The Vicar of Wakefield". Goldsmith's biggest work at that time was "The Citizen of the World" (1762), a collection of soft-satire essays on English life seen by an imaginary Chinese visitor. He also wrote two plays, "The Good Natured Man" (1768), and "She Stoops to Conquer (1773).(He is also thought to have written the classic children's story, "The History of Little Goody Two-Shoes".)
It is not known for sure when he was born. Most people now think that he was born in 10 November 1730. He was the second son of Charles Goldsmith, curate of Kilkenny West in West Meath in Ireland. In 1745 he went to Trinity College Dublin. He quickly spent all his money by gambling, which he became to. After spending some time at the Universities of Edinburgh and Leyden he spent 1755 – 1756 travelling in Europe, where it is said that he lived by playing the flute. Before starting to write he worked in London as a doctor's helper, a doctor, and a school . He died in 1774 and was buried in Temple Church.

Sea spider

Sea spiders are marine arthropods of the class Pycnogonida. 
There are about 1,300 species of sea spiders, which are found around the world. Sea spiders are found in all oceans, including the Mediterranean Sea, Caribbean Sea, and the Arctic Ocean. Species found in coastal waters are usually small and have a leg span of about 1 inch (2.5 cm), those living at great depths, up to 24 inches (60 cm).
Sea spiders are not true spiders, or even arachnids. Their traditional classification as chelicerates would put them closer to true spiders than to other well-known arthropod groups, such as insects or crustaceans. 
However, recent genetic evidence suggests they may be an ancient sister group to all other living arthropods.
The sea spider has a small, narrow body. It usually has four pairs of long, thin legs attached to the abdomen. Attached to the head there are usually three other pairs of appendages—a pair called chelicerae, used for grasping food; a pair of sensory projections called palps; and a pair of egg-carrying legs (sometimes underdeveloped or absent in the female). The female lays round masses of eggs on the egg-carrying legs of the male, which carries the eggs until they hatch.
On top of its head, the sea spider has a knobby projection bearing two, three, or four simple eyes. The head ends in a snout with a sucking mouth. Sea spiders feed by sucking the body juices of such marine animals as sea anemones, sponges, and sea squirts.

Caving

Caving (or spelunking) is the hobby or recreation of exploring caves. People who explore caves are called spelunkers.
Wise spelunkers explore in groups, to prevent being lost or stranded in a cave. Spelunkers need reliable equipment, because the descent into a cave is like mountain climbing in the opposite direction. Basic spelunking equipment is similar to what mountain climbers use. Strong ropes make climbing possible and special tools attach ropes to cave walls. Special footwear makes it easier to explore hard to reach places, and hard hats protect spelunkers from falling rocks above. Caves are extremely dark, so spelunkers have to carry at least three light sources (like torches and flares). One torch attaches to a spelunker's helmet so it is with him or her at all times. Caves are also very cold, so most spelunkers wear heavy clothing for warmth.
Spelunkers tie their ropes with different kinds of knots, like the "farmer's hitch knot" and the "alpine butterfly knot". Spelunkers choose different knots for different purposes. Some knots work well to hold people as they climb. Other knots are best for tying ropes together.
Caving today has become a hobby for many different reasons. Some cavers are interested in conservation. Others are interested in gathering hard data about caves (called speleology). Geologists explore caves for the purpose of learning about the formation of rocks. But, for most of the rest, the purpose of caving is just to have fun.
Caves can generally be explored during any season of the year. Most caves remain at the same temperature year round. The common rules of thumb apply:

Chiton

Chitons are primitive marine molluscs in the class Polyplacophora (formerly the class Amphineura). There are 900 to 1,000 living species of chitons. Their size ranges from 0.5 to 30 cm in length; most are quite small. 
All the living species are in the subclass Neoloricata, and so may be called 'loricates'. Popular names are "sea cradles" or "coat-of-mail shells". 
They have a single shell that sticks to rocks, like a limpet. The shell is made of hard plates that fit tightly together, overlapping one another. The shell plates are surrounded by a structure known as a 'girdle'.
Polyplacophora means "many plates". The plates refer to the shell, which is made of aragonite, a calcium carbonate mineral. The shell is quite flexible, and the chiton can even roll into a ball. The chiton has eight plates, and underneath the plates is a muscular foot that moves the chiton over rocks and other structures, both in and out of the water. It also has a tongue-shaped structure called the radula, which has many rows of 17 teeth each. Some use it to scrape algae off rocks, while others are carnivorous, catching tiny zooplankton and other small animals that live in shallow water.
Chitons can be less than an inch long, or up to a foot long. They come in many different colors: black, red, pink, and even blue. The shell might be shiny or dull, or smooth, hairy, scaly, or spiny depending on the species.
If a chiton was picked up and turned over, there would be no eyes, legs, or arms. There would only be a wide foot with a radula that it uses for scraping surfaces. Its mantle is right under the shell, with the lowest part of the mantle coming out under the edge of the shell to help its foot grip the surfaces on which it clings or slides along. The part of the mantle which sticks out is called the "girdle". Like the moon snail, the girdle may extend out over the bottom part of the shell covering the bottom half of the chiton. 
Most chitons are "nocturnal", so they feed at night, and hide under rocks during the day. Their main habitat is the intertidal zone. They live on hard surfaces, such as on or under rocks, or in rock crevices. Some species live quite high in the intertidal zone and are exposed to the air and light for long periods. Others live subtidally. A few species live in deep water, as deep as 6,000 m (about 20,000 ft).
Chitons have a relatively good fossil record, stretching back 400 million years to the Devonian. Before this, some organisms have been interpreted (tentatively) as stem-group polyplacophora; the record of polyplacophora stretches back to the Upper Cambrian.
"Kimberella" and "Wiwaxia " of the Precambrian and Cambrian may be related to ancestral polyplacophora. "Matthevia" is a late Cambrian polyplacophoran preserved as individual pointed valves, and sometimes considered to be a chiton. The polyplacophorans may have formed when an aberrant monoplacophoran was born with multiple centres of calcification, rather than the usual one. Selection acted on the resultant conical shells to form them to overlap into protective armour. Their original cones are homologous with the tips of the plates of modern chitons.

Sand dollar

The Sand dollars, are species of flattened, burrowing sea urchins belonging to the order Clypeasteroida. "Echinarachnius parma", the Common Sand Dollar, is widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, from the intertidal zone to considerable depths. Sand dollars can be found in temperate and tropical zones, but not in Great Britain.
All sand dollars have a rigid skeleton known as a "test". This is the typical white disk found washed up on beaches. The living animals have a skin of movable spines on the test. Movement is done by the action of the spines. Like other sea urchins, sand dollars have five paired rows of pores. The pores are arranged in a petal-like pattern. These pores are perforations in the endoskeleton through which the tube feet, used in gas exchange, project from the body.
Living sand dollars have small spines covering its entire body. They are softer and much shorter than those of the sea urchin. Like all echinoderms, sand dollars have tube feet. They are not used to move around, but simply to breathe. The sand dollar's tube feet actually stick out of the top of the sand dollar. On a sand dollar test, there is usually a pattern that looks like the petals of a flower. That pattern is made up of many tiny holes, and it is through these holes that the sand dollar's tube feet came out when it was alive.
A sand dollar uses its tiny spines to move around, and to dig into the sand. It often does this to bury itself in the sand. Sometimes, a sand dollar will only partially bury itself in the sand, and ends up poking up from the sand, standing on its side.
On the underside of a sand dollar, there is a star pattern spreading out from the center where the mouth is. This star pattern is made up of that are called "food grooves". Sand dollars filter sand and water, catching plankton and other things on their spines. Then, with cilia, the spines move the food into a food groove, and the food travels down the food groove to the mouth. Its food consists of crustacean larvae, small copepods, diatoms, algae and detritus.
The sand dollars are the most specialised sea urchins. All their features are adaptations for burrowing. They live just beneath the sand, either flat or at an angle. At an angle they keep the edge facing the oncoming currents, presumably to catch food. This excellent habitat has been taken up by other groups of sea urchins. The heart urchins, another order, are even more effective in burrowing. Sand dollars can live for up to 160 years.
Most living sand dollars have dark colours, like brown or purple. Their darker color helps them stay camouflaged, easily hiding in the sand or mud or on the sea floor. The tests of sand dollars do not have bristles and tube feet, and because of the sun, they usually become white.

Ot en Sien

Ot en Sien (Ot and Sien) are two little children who appear in a series of stories which were written in the Dutch language more than a hundred years ago. Ot (short for “Otto”) is a little boy and Sien (pronounced like the English word “seen”), whose name may be short for “Francine”, is the little girl who lives next door. Although they are now very old-fashioned, the books are still popular in Holland. They were written in rhyme and were illustrated with colourful pictures.
The author of the stories was called Hendricus Scheepstra. The ideas for the stories were given to him by Jan Ligthart. Cornelis Jetses made the illustrations.
The stories are set in Drenthe, which is in the north-eastern part of the Netherlands. Drenthe was a very poor part of the country, but Ot and Sien live in a nice house and are quite well-off. They are often seen playing in the garden with their toys which include a wooden horse on wheels and a doll in a dolly’s pushchair. The cat is often in the picture. They are also seen at school.
The authors wrote the stories to show a happy family life. Everyone is very friendly in the book, and strangers help them when they get lost in the street. The family have a servant who helps in the house.
The stories were widely read by children in schools in the Netherlands until after the Second World War. By then they had become very old-fashioned. The daily life of Ot and Sien seemed to belong to a time long ago in history. Hardly any Dutch children now live in a family with a servant. No Dutch child nowadays goes for a walk dressed in sailor’s costume with a father who wears a cloak and hat. The books are no longer read in schools, but they continue to be popular with Dutch people at home. In 2004, one hundred years after the first book was written, a special exhibition about Ot and Sien was held.
There is a statue to Ot and Sien in The Hague, made in 1930.
In the Dutch language there are expressions which refer to Ot and Sien.

An exhibition is an organized event in which a collection of special objects can be viewed by the public. The objects are often brought together from many places for the period of the exhibition. The objects on show are called exhibits.
Museums often organize special exhibitions, such as paintings by a famous painter. These paintings will mostly be “on loan”, i.e. specially borrowed from other museums. Exhibitions can be about anything. They may be to do with art, or they can also be science exhibitions.
Some exhibitions show things which can be bought. Firms exhibit the things they have made, hoping to encourage business. These exhibitions are called trade fairs. They are sometimes called expositions or expos. They may be open to the public, but others are just for invited business people.

Ruben Bierer

Ruben Bierer (Dr. "Rubin Bierer", often: "Reuben Bierer"; * about 1845 in Lviv; † 1931 ibid.) was a doctor in Sofia and one of the first pioneers of the Jewish nationalism and one of the first active zionists in Galicia and Bulgaria, adherent of Hovevei Zion in Galicia, Austria and Bulgaria.
In 1867 he was in Lviv a co-founder of the first Jewish-political association of Austria-Hungary, "Shomer Israel". As an opponent against Polish assimilation of the Jews he established for the 1873 elections of the Reichsrat a Jewish-ruthenian electoral alliance. In 1879 he separated from the "Shomer Israel" and went to Vienna for the purpose of medical studies where he – together with Peretz Smolenskin – found the Jewish-political association "Ahavath Zion" (for the reason of colonisation of the holy land).
In 1882 he was a cofounder of the Viennese "Kadima" Studentenverbindung. In 1883 he returned to Lviv where he founded the first Jewish-national association of the Austrian east, "Miqra Kodesh".
In 1885 he went to Serbia, in 1900 he returned to Lviv where he successless tried to reactivate the "Shomer Israel". 
Nathan Birnbaum coined the word zionism about the year 1890. But he is not the creator of this word, it was already in use, e.g. you can find in a letter of Ruben Bierer from the 9th December 1888 the expression "zionist brother's greeting". The word "zionist" is found already in the year 1877 in an in Roumanian written pamphlet (annual report of the order "Zion" in Bucharest).

Hezekiah (meaning God will strengthen) or Ḥizqiyyāhu (Hebrew), also translated as Ḥizkiyyahu (and sometimes as Ezekias (Greek), Khizkiyahu, Yəḥizqiyyāhu, Y'khizkiyahu), was a king of Judah that appears in the book of 2 Chronicles, chapters 18 to 32, and the book of 2 Kings chapters 18 to 20. He was one of the few kings who is compared favorably with David, and is unique for his trust in the Lord: "There was no one like him among all the kings of Judah, either before him or after him. He held fast to the LORD and did not cease (stop) to follow him" (NIV).
Hezekiah was the son of Judah's King Ahaz, and is best known for turning his people away from the sins of his father Ahaz, restoring worship in the temple, and having his life made 15 years longer. The Book of 2 Chronicles tells more about Hezekiah than any other king after Solomon, and suggests that he is a "second Solomon" in his celebration of the Passover, his wealth, his honor, and his land.
Toward the end of his reign, he became very sick and close to death. He prayed to the Lord, who healed him miraculously. The king of Babylon heard about it and sent men with a letter and gift to Hezekiah. Because Hezekiah was proud of his riches, he showed all of his treasures to the visitors. The prophet Isaiah predicted that it all would later be taken by the Babylonians. His prediction came true.

Korean magpie

The Korean magpie" Pica (pica) sericea" is a subspecies, or perhaps species, of East Asian magpie. It is a common symbol of Korea, and has been adopted as the "official bird" of many South Korean cities and counties.
It is similar to the European magpie, with a shorter tail and longer wings. It has black and purple colors, but very little green. The Korean magpie has the same chattering call as European magpies, though it is much softer.
Koreans believed that magpies delivered good news, and when they saw a magpie chattering, they believed that visitors were coming.The most famous painting related to a magpie is the one with striped tiger (ggach'i wha horangi minhwa): the magpie is chirping to a tiger. The magpie represented good news and the tiger symbolized good luck, since its pronunciation in Chinese sounds similar to good luck (bok). There are many folktales about magpies.
The Chinese called magpies "Birds of Joy" or "Happy Magpies". Under the Manchu dynasty it also represented imperial rule: a few Manchu people in Northeast China even thought they were gods. In the west, though, magpies were often a symbol of pride.

<doc id="225630" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=225630" title="Left-handedness">
Left-handedness

Left-handedness is the preference to use the left hand more than the right hand for daily activities such as writing or using tools. Most people can use either hand for many things. However, people very often have a definite preference for using the left or right hand for things such as: using a pen, using a knife, using scissors, brushing teeth, blowing their nose, and so on. People who do not have a preference are called ambidextrous, and people who cannot use either are called ambisinistrous.
People do not just have preferences with things they do with their hands: they may, for example, be left-footed if they prefer to kick a ball with the left foot, or push harder with the left foot on a bicycle pedal.
Far more people are right handed than left handed. It is difficult to measure exactly how many, because each person has a different mixture of preferences, but about 5-10% are left-handed.
Because left-handed people are different from most others, being left-handed has often been thought of as bad. For many years, right-handedness was seen as "normal" and left-handedness as "not normal". In Hebrew, as well as in other ancient Semitic and Mesopotamian languages, the word "left" was a symbol of power. In many European languages, "right" means “correct” (the opposite of “wrong”). In law the word “right” means authority and justice (in a democracy everyone has certain “rights". In Russian and other Slavic languages "prav" is used in words meaning “correct” or “truth”. Someone who is skilled with their hands is called “dexterous”. But "left" often means “awkward” in many languages. In French “gauche” also means “clumsy”. In English, the word “sinister” (which comes from the Latin word for “left”, "sinistra") means “evil”. We also say that someone has “two left feet” meaning that they are clumsy with their feet (for example they may step on their partner’s toes when dancing).
Sometimes people who are left-handed are called “Southpaws”.
Things that are designed by right-handed people can cause problems for left-handed ones. These include guns, cameras, screws and in recent years the computer mouse and the iPhone. Many objects are sold in left-handed versions, which are often more expensive than the right-handed versions. Some items such as a computer mouse can be designed for right handed people but still be used by left handed people and in some cases may even be an improvement for right handed users. 
Scissors, especially, cause left-handed people some trouble. Most scissors are made for right-handed people. Because they are designed this way, if a person tries to cut something while holding the scissors in their left hand, they cannot see the edge they are cutting. The way the cutting action works is also designed for right-handers, and left-handed people tend to force the blades open instead of cutting cleanly. Even though some scissors say that they can be used by both left and right-handed people, these scissors only have their handles changed. They are still right-handed scissors and still cause the same issues.
It can be difficult for left-handed children to learn to write if the teacher does not give them special help. The reason for this is that most writing moves from left to right across the page. This means that left-handed writers may hold their hand over what has just been written.
In many countries, children are allowed to write with whichever hand is easier, although there are some countries where children may be made to write with the right hand. Many things can be difficult for left-handed writers. Chairs with writing boards may all be made for right-handed people. This makes left-handed people sit awkwardly and hold their pens in an awkward way.
Recent research has shown that it can be an advantage for animals and for humans to be left-handed. Being able to do things differently from most people can be a great help in many sports, such as tennis or fighting with swords.
In tennis, left-handed players hold the racket in their left hand. Because of this, their grip of the handle is supposedly adjusted in a slightly different style from right-handed players. Some world champion tennis players that play with their left hand include Jimmy Connors, Guillermo Vilas, John McEnroe, Martina Navratilova, Marcelo Ríos, and Rafael Nadal.

Seeing a cumulus cloud means that the air is well mixed by up and down vertical drafts. When a cumulus cloud grows into a thunderstorm, the cloud is called a cumulonimbus cloud. This is a sign that the air is rising to the stratosphere.

Alyosha Karamazov

Alexei Fyodorovich Karamazov is the "hero" of Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel, "The Brothers Karamazov". He is also called Alyosha, Alyoshka, Alyoshenka, Alyoshechka, Alexeichik, Lyosha, and Lyoshenka. He is the youngest of the Karamazov brothers, being "then only twenty (his brother Ivan was twenty-three and their older brother, Dmitry, twenty-seven)". The author's preface and first chapters declare that he is the novel's hero.
Alyosha is physically described as:
His personality is remarkably unselfish, extremely mature in his religious faith, sensitive to other people's feelings, and loving - "he certainly loved people: throughout his life he seemed to believe in people and to trust them, and yet no one ever thought him simple-minded or naive. There was something in him (and it stayed with him all his life) that made people realize that he refused to sit in judgment on others, that he felt he had no right to, and that, whatever happened, he would never condemn anyone." He passes on the influence of Zosima to the "younger generation" (the schoolboys) of the town. Even with all his kind goodness, he has a gentle personality that makes almost everybody love him and feel comfortable around him. Proud young Kolya Krasotkin says that the best thing about Alyosha is that he treats him like "an equal".
Anna-Theresa Tymieniecka says that Alyosha, like Prince Myshkin, the protagonist in another Dostoevsky novel, "The Idiot", are almost Jesus-like characters, who are, however, unable to stop the greatest suffering of those around them. She suggests that Alyosha is too calm, and does not do much action in the events of the novel.
Rufus W. Mathewson, however, argues that Alyosha Karamazov is a more successful positive hero than Prince Myshkin. He argues that Alyosha's most impressive success as helping Dmitri. He describes Alyosha as using forgiveness, kindness and natural justice, rather than trying to change people.
It is probable that Dostoevsky used his friend Vladimir Solovyov's character for Alyosha. Vladimir Solovyov was a Russian poet and philosopher who was very generous, even giving away his clothes to people in the street.

Stratus cloud

Stratus clouds are low altitude gray clouds that make a flat base. The name comes from the Latin word "stratus", which means to "stretch" or "extend." You can see stratus clouds as thick cloud blankets near the sea. They are sometimes called "high fogs". Light rain and drizzle often fall from stratus clouds. When rain falls from stratus clouds they are mostly called nimbostratus.

Pliosaur

The Pliosaurs were a group of large submarine plesiosaur reptiles from the Mesozoic era. They had short necks and large heads, in contrast to other plesiosaurs. Their sizes ranged from two to 15 metres, and they were predators of large fish and other reptiles. Their streamlined body shape suggests they swam and ate under water.
The first specimen was found by Mary Anning, on the 'Jurassic Coast' of Lyme Regis, England in the 1820s. Many of her finds are on display in the Natural History Museum, London.
It was suggested by D.M.S. Watson that plesiosaurs fell into two groups. The pliosaurs were large predators which ate large prey in deep water. The other plesiosaurs were long-necked with smaller heads. Their method was as surface swimmers, mostly eating with their head above water, darting down to snatch smaller fish which were feeding on plankton.

Ball lightning

Ball lightning is a glowing ball of lightning that sometimes appears in a thunderstorm, but usually lasts much longer than lightning. Scientists do not understand ball lightning very well, and some even do not think ball lightning is real, because it is so strange. However, it has been widely reported in weather journals by many trustworthy people. So, it is very possible that it is real.
Those who have seen it say it's the size of a grapefruit or basketball; it has even been said to be as big as a car. The glowing ball is either red, orange, or yellow. A few people have seen it falling from clouds. Sometimes, ball lightning floats or glides just above the ground for a few seconds, or it can roll on the surface of an object. Hissing noises come from the fiery orb. Some have even thought it was a UFO. Ball lightning sometimes explodes loudly, while other times it just quietly disappears. It has been known to smash or simply go through windows, hopping and sizzling across the floor, and then disappear into things like TVs or up the chimney. Some say that ball lightning can kill humans, while others say that its effect on humans are harmless.
Many people are said to have seen ball lightning. Ebenezer Cobham Brewer wrote about "globular lightning", saying they may fall to the ground or explode like a cannon. Laura Ingalls Wilder writes in her book about ball lightning, saying that when she was little, she saw balls of light, which her mother chased away with a broom. 
Czar Nicholas II, Russia's last emperor, said he had seen ball lightning:

Sauropterygia

The Sauropterygia was a superorder of successful aquatic reptiles that flourished during the Mesozoic era. They are united by an adaptation of their shoulder, designed to support powerful paddle strokes. Some later sauropterygians like the pliosaurs developed a similar mechanism in their pelvis.
The earliest sauropterygians appeared about 245 million years ago, at the start of the Triassic period. At first they were small, less than a metre. They were semi-aquatic lizard-like animals with long limbs (called pachypleurosaurs). They developed into a group called the nothosaurs, several meters long. The sauropterygians included another very distinctive group: the placodonts. They were bottom-feeders on shellfish, and possessed flat, crushing teeth to handle their prey.
The end-Triassic extinction event wiped them all out except for the plesiosaurs. During the earliest Jurassic these diversified quickly into the long-necked small-headed plesiosaurs proper, and short-necked large-headed pliosaurs.

Oceanic trench

Ocean trenches have relatively steep sides falling to the ocean floor.
Ocean trenches are typically caused when an oceanic crustal plate slides under a lighter continental plate or another oceanic plate. It is believed to work by density. Where one plate slides under another, this is called subduction. As the heavier plate descends, the long, narrow feature caused is called the "subduction zone". It is here that oceanic trenches form. They can be 1,500 miles (2,400 km) long, several miles deep, and as much as 70 miles (112 km) wide.
At least five trenches are over 6 miles (10 km) deep. The greatest ocean depth to be sounded is in the Challenger Deep of the Mariana Trench, at a depth of 
Trenches are active with earthquakes and resulting tsunamis. Most volcanism associated with trenches occurs on the continent and not on the sea floor. However, many of the ocean's volcanic islands and seamounts are found in what are called island arcs, bending chains of islands rising from the sea floor, usually paralleling the concave edges of an oceanic trench. The western Pacific has island arcism as do the Aleutian Islands.
Near the island of Guam is the famous Mariana Trench where the Pacific Plate descends under the leading edge of the Eurasian Plate. Measured at 36,201 feet - over 6.8 miles (11 km) deep, this trench is the deepest known spot in any ocean. In 1960, two men in the bathyscaph "Trieste" reached bottom of the Mariana Trench. 
Other extensive trench regions around the world include the South Sandwich Trench between South America and Antarctica, the Peru-Chile Trench, and the Aleutian Trench.

Unlike the Strpce municipality which is autonomous, North Kosovo is directly run by the Government of Belgrade.
In North Kosovo, Serbian car plates are still used and the Serbian dinar is used as the official currency.
The enclave consists of the 3 municipalities of Zvecan, Leposavic, Zubin Potok (as well as part of Mitrovica. The enclave's area is (11% of the country's total area). Lake Gorazdevac is also in the enclave.
The United Nations does not recognize Kosovo as a country because of the 1999 United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244. Other world governing bodies do not recognise it as a country, either.

Oviparous animals

Oviparous animals are animals that reproduce by laying eggs. This is how most fish, amphibians, reptiles, insects, and arachnids reproduce. All birds and monotremes also reproduce like this.
The eggs that of most animals that live on land are protected by hard shells. They fertilize their eggs internally. Water-dwelling animals like fish and amphibians lay eggs that have not been fertilized yet. Then the males lay sperm on top of the eggs, which is called external fertilization.
No mammals except for monotremes reproduce like this. Instead, they are viviparous. This means that the embryos develop inside the mother's womb

Aplacophora

The Aplacophora is a class of small, deep-water, exclusively benthic, shell-less marine molluscs. They are found in all oceans of the world. They are a small group of molluscs which have deviated from the normal molluscan form. There are approximately 100 known species living today. They are rather worm-like and average about an inch (2.5 cms.) in length. 
Most live in deep water, except a few more northern species. One group bury themselves into the sand and mud of the ocean bottom where they feed on annelids and other small invertebrates. The rest of the known aplacophorans parasitize hydroids and other corals.
This class used to be classified as sea cucumbers in the echinoderms. In 1987, they were officially recognized as molluscs and given their own class. The class is polyphyletic, and consists of two clades.

Monoplacophora

Monoplacophora is a class of molluscs. They have a cap-like shell and live on the bottom of the sea. 
They were well-known as a fossil group from the Cambrian to the Devonian. One species was dredged up from the Pacific Ocean off Mexico in 1952. It was found to be a Monoplacophoran, and given the genus of "Neopilina". This was one of the most remarkable modern discoveries of a 'living fossil', and a Lazarus taxon. 
More than that, they are the most extreme example of the "pull of the recent", which is a term in palaeontology. All fossil groups have a first and last appearance in the fossil record but, for living species, their last appearance is the present day. This may be very much later than their last appearance as a fossil. The discovery of the living monoplacs extended their time range by 400 million years.
The anatomy of "Neopilina" shows "serially repeated structures" such as gills. Serial repetition of anatomical structures such as gills and muscles may have evolved once in the common ancestor of chitons and monoplacophorans. It suggests the ancient ancestor of molluscs had bilateral symmetry, and segments.

The slender loris is a nocturnal hunter. It moves slowly through trees and grips branches tightly with its opposable thumbs and toes. When it attacks prey it goes closer and then snatches it with both hands. 
The slender loris is about the size of a squirrel, and has small finger nails. It has two brown eyes, and has white fur on its chest. 
The slender loris usually spends its time on trees. They like to groom and wrestle with each other.
These animals eat insects, lizards, birds, but will also eat things like slugs, flowers, shoots, young leaves, and sometimes even eggs. They would also like termites and roaches for a tasty treat.
Native people thought that the slender lorises had magical powers. It is not clear how many slender lorises survive in the wild.

Bartje Bartels is the main character in a series of Dutch books written by Anne de Vries at the beginning of the 20th century. The stories are about a boy who grows up in a poor family in the countryside in Drenthe in the north-east of the Netherlands.
The author Anne de Vries is male. The name “Anne”, although usually a girl's name, can also be used as a boy’s name in Dutch, especially in the north where Frisian is spoken. It is pronounced “Oa-ne”.
Bartje (pronounce: “BAR-che”) is a boy whose father is a poor farmer. His parents expect him to become a farmer like his father, but Bartje has other ideas. Bartje starts work as an apprentice, but then his mother dies and he has to look after his younger brothers and sisters.
The most famous quotation from the Bartje books come in the story in which the family are sitting down to a meal. They are going to eat brown beans. Bartje hates brown beans and pulls his empty plate away when his mother wants to give him some. He refuses to say grace (to say a prayer to thank God for the food they are about to eat) and he says: "Ik bid nie veur bruune boon'n " (in modern Dutch: "Ik bid niet voor bruine bonen", meaning: "I don’t pray for brown beans"). His parents are shocked and he gets into big trouble.
Bartje has become a much-loved symbol for the province of Drenthe. The stories were made into a television series which was shown in 1972 and repeated in 2004. The film had Dutch subtitles because the actors were speaking in Drenthe dialect. 
There is a statue to Bartje in the town of Assen. Unfortunately it has been vandalized several times.

Strepsirrhini

The Strepsirrhini clade is one of the two suborders of primates, with 114 species. They are defined by their wet noses, although the Greek name means having a curved or bent nose. Madagascar's only primates (apart from humans) are strepsirrhines, although others can be found in southeast Asia.
Their eyes have a reflective layer to improve their night vision, and their eye sockets have a ring of bone around the eye. Strepsirrhine primates produce their own vitamin C, whereas haplorhine primates (and ourselves) must get it from their diets. 
The suborder contains the lemurs and lorises. The modern types probably evolved from the Adapiforms, an extinct group.
The origin of the earliest primates, from which both the strepsirrhines and haplorhines (simians and tarsiers) evolved, is a mystery. Both their place of origin and the group from which they evolved are uncertain. 
Although the fossil record of their initial radiation across the Northern Hemisphere is very detailed, the fossil record from the tropics—where primates most likely evolved—is very poor, particularly around the time that primates and other eutherian mammals were first appearing. 
So, geneticists and primatologists have used genetic analyses to determine the relatedness between primate lines and when they diverged. Using this molecular clock, it seems that primates evolved more than 80–90 mya, nearly 40 million years before the first primates appear in the fossil record.

Rainbow Serpent

A Rainbow Serpent is an animal in the Dreamtime which many of the indigenous people of Australia, the "Aborigines", believe created the mountains, rivers and lakes. The Rainbow Serpent stories are found all across Australia, and especially in Arnhem Land, in the north of Australia. The serpent is known by different names, such as "Almudj" and "Ngalyod", in different Aboriginal languages. The Rainbow Serpent lives in waterholes and controls the supply of water.
Aboriginal artists have painted the Rainbow Serpent on cave walls or on pieces of bark. The earliest cave paintings found are about 8,000 years old. In special ceremonies, they sometimes honour the Rainbow Serpent by painting their handprints on the magic snake. Scientists believe the Rainbow Serpent stories began at the end of the last ice age. The rising sea levels would have forced a lot of people to move inland. The Rainbow Serpent became a symbol of both creation and destruction, and of unity and peace. This makes the Rainbow Serpent a symbol of the world's oldest continuing religion.
In the Dreamtime, the Rainbow Serpent helped the world along with rain. At the beginning of time, the Rainbow Serpent awoke from its sleep and pushed through the Earth's crust. As it travelled over the empty land, it left behind deep tracks. The Rainbow Serpent called to the frogs to come out from beneath the earth. It tickled the frogs' bellies, and when they laughed, water poured out from their open mouths. The water filled the Rainbow Serpent's deep tracks, making rivers and lakes.
Slowly, grass began to grow. Then all kind of creatures in Australia - birds, lizards, snakes, kangaroos, koalas, and dingoes - woke up and took their places on the earth.

Shawnee Park

Shawnee Park is a park in Louisville, Kentucky. It was created by Frederick Law Olmsted, who made 18 of the city's 123 public parks. Along with the rest of the city's Olmsted-designed park system, Shawnee Park was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.
Shawnee Park was first planned in 1890 to be one of the free flagship parks in Louisville's new park system. All three were found on the geographic edges of the city. In Shawnee's case, it was the western edge bordering the Ohio River. The land at the time was still mostly used for truck farms, but it was clear residential development was imminent even without the park. Shawnee was the slowest of the parks to create, as much of the land was already owned by investors who thought they could increase the sale price by holding out.
The city had to force owners to sell the properties to obtain the land for the park, and won the case in 1895. In 1896, the city started to create access to the park, another area in which Shawnee was behind the other two parks. River Park Drive was laid out in 1899, but the Broadway entrance remained unfinished until 1914.
The Olmsted firm advised the city not to build a golf course at Shawnee Park due to the "grave danger to visitors in the park and especially the children" but demand was such that the course was built anyway in 1927.
All three parks had the intended effect of spurring residential development near them. The interest was so great that developers found themselves promoting the parks rather than their own developments, as the highest prices would exist for the park perceived to be best. Dozens of subdivisions were built near Shawnee Park, and the neighborhood itself came to be called Shawnee.
Shawnee Park allowed access only to whites from 1924 to 1954, although park officials and police had a de facto policy of not allowing blacks access to the park for some years prior to that. The only park blacks were allowed access to was nearby Chickasaw Park, which many people entered by traveling through Shawnee.
Although now overshadowed by the Louisville Waterfront Park, Shawnee boasts an expansive Great Lawn which is very useful for formal gatherings. The Great Lawn, the principal feature of the park, is enclosed by plantings and a circular drive that is lined with trees.
Louisville's Riverwalk Trail, which passes through Shawnee Park, extends across Louisville's waterfront, which is an extensive, mostly flat pedestrian pathway. The one-way distance between the Belvedere and Shawnee Park is 6.2 miles.

The male is 22 centimeters in length with the elongated outer tail-feathers accounting for 14-15 centimeters. Its color is mostly green. The throat is blue and the outer tail-feathers are violet, becoming blue towards the tips. The female is 9.5-11 centimeters long. The tail is shorter than that of the male but still fairly long and slightly forked. Females have a blue crown and white throat, breast and belly.
The Long-tailed Sylph is almost the same in color but does not overlap in range. Males of the subspecies "caudatus" have a mostly blue tail and no blue throat patch, while males of the subspecies "margarethae" have green tips to the tail-feathers. Females have a rufous breast and belly.

An apocalypse is a revelation: seeing something which has been hidden. It comes from the Greek word, "Apokálypsis", which means "lifting of the veil", or finding out something secret. Often this secret is discovered in a dream or a vision.
In religion, the word describes Armageddon or the end of the world. This might have come from the words, "apokalupsis eschaton", meaning all the secrets will be discovered "at the end of the æon, or age". In Christianity "The Apocalypse of John" is the Book of Revelation, the last book of the Bible. It describes the end of the world, and the second coming of Jesus Christ.

Edward Jenner

Edward Jenner (17 May 1749 – 26 January 1823) was an English physician known for creating the vaccine for smallpox.
Vaccination as a concept was known long before Jenner. 
In 1765, Dr John Fewster published a paper in the London Medical Society entitled "Cow pox and its ability to prevent smallpox", but he did not pursue the subject further.
After 1770, at least five investigators in England and Germany (Sevel, Jensen, Jesty 1774, Rendell, Plett 1791) successfully tested a cowpox vaccine in humans against smallpox. For example, Dorset farmer Benjamin Jesty successfully vaccinated and presumably induced immunity with cowpox in his wife and two children during a smallpox epidemic in 1774. Jenner may have been aware of Jesty's procedures and success, but after Jenner's work some 20 years later the procedure became widely understood at last. 
It was a common observation that milkmaids were generally immune to smallpox. Jenner thought that the pus in the blisters that milkmaids received from cowpox (a disease similar to smallpox, but much less virulent) protected them from smallpox. He may already have heard of Benjamin Jesty's success.
On 14 May 1796, Jenner tested his hypothesis on an eight-year-old boy, the son of his gardener. He scraped pus from cowpox blisters on the hands of a milkmaid. Jenner inoculated Phipps in both arms that day, subsequently producing in Phipps a fever and some uneasiness, but no full-blown infection. Later, he injected the boy with a mild form of smallpox and he showed no sign of infection. Jenner successfully tested his hypothesis on 23 more subjects.

The Barossa Valley is in South Australia. It is found about north-east of Adelaide, the capital city of South Australia. The Barossa Valley is famous for making wine and because of this it often has many tourists. The three main towns in the region are Nuriootpa, Tanunda and Angaston.
The Barossa Valley was named in 1837 by a surveyor called Colonel William Light. It was meant to be named Barrosa, named after the town in Spain, but a mistake was made and it ended up being spelt Barossa.
The first place to be settled was Bethany in 1842 by people from both England and Germany. Most of the people to first arrive were from Germany and because of this the Barossa Valley has lots of German heritage. Soon after Bethany was established other towns were made. the next group of town to be created were: Angaston, Krondorf, Ebenezer, Penrice, Light Pass and Langmeil.
The year after the first town was made, churches stared being built. These were all Christian churches and most were Lutheran. The Christian lifestyle is still around the Barossa Valley today with lots of churches still around, although many are not Lutheran.
There are about 20 000 people who live in the Barossa Valley. Most of these people live in Tanunda, Nuriootpa, Angaston, Williamstown and Lyndoch, each having more than 1000 people. A few smaller towns such as Moculta and Springton are in the Barossa Valley too and all the town are a part of the Barossa Local Government which is more commonly called the Barossa Council.
Most people in the area still call themselves Lutherans. This has caused many towns to have two or more Lutheran churches. For example, Tanunda has four, Nuriootpa has two and Angaston has two. Each town with more than 1000 people, not including Williamstown, has a Lutheran Primary School and Tanunda has a Lutheran Secondary School.
The number of people in all of the biggest towns is listed below.
The Barossa Valley is called "‘Australia's most famous wine region’" by lots of people. There are about 150 wineries in the Barossa Valley. Some of the wineries are very famous both in Australia and overseas. The famous wineries include: Wolf Blass, Penfolds, Yalumba and Peter Lehmann Wines. The two secondary schools in the area both have wineries. Nuriootpa High School owns a winery called Barossa Class Wines (more commonly known as Nurrihannam Wines) and Faith Lutheran School owns a winery called Mengler View Wines.
Every two years this festival is held in the Barossa Valley to celebrate the vintage. Vintage is the time between grapes been picked and then turned into wine. The vintage festival lasts for 9 days and on each day many events take place.
The most popular of all the events is the parade. This is where different companies and groups gather a few volunteers who parade from the main street in Nuriootpa through to the main street in Tanunda. Many groups choose to give out free gifts, such as lollies and stickers.

Art history

Art history is the study of art. An art historian is a person who studies the history of art, and then writes about it or teaches about it so that other people can learn about this subject as well. 
The first person to become an art historian was Giorgio Vasari. He lived in Florence during the Renaissance, at a time when there were many famous artists alive. Vasari was an artist himself. He decided to write down all the stories that were told in Florence about the many different artists who had made the city famous. He included biographies of several other artists from Northern Italy as well. When all the information was collected and the biographies written, he published them in 1568 in a book called "Lives of the Artists". Because of this book, art students today have a lot of information about artists such as Leonardo, Michelangelo, Titian and their works.

Dugong

The dugong, "Dugong dugon," is a large mammal that lives its whole life in the sea. 
They are sometimes called "sea cows" as they eat large amounts of sea grass. They live in warm, shallow areas where the sea grass grows. This area includes the north coast of Australia, and in other countries in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. 
Dugongs are more closely related to elephants than to other sea creatures. Their closest aquatic relative is the manatee, a fresh water species found in America and West Africa.
The dugong can grow to about long and weigh as much as . They only come to the surface to breathe, and unlike seals, they never come up on the land. A baby dugong is called a calf. It drinks milk from its mother until about two years old. A dugong reaches its adult size between the ages of 9 and 17 years. The dugong can live for up to 70 years of age. They are grey to brown in color. They have a tail with flukes, like a whale, and flippers. They do not have a dorsal fin like a shark. They have a wide flat nose, small eyes, and small ears.
The dugong is a migratory animal, but very slow moving. Studies by James Cook University showed that while many dugongs traveled less than , some went as far as . Scientists believe that dugongs move long distances for several reasons. They may be looking for food, as cyclones or floods can affect the seagrass. Males may be following females, or looking for their own territory. If the water gets cold, less than 17 degrees Centigrade, they will travel to warmer areas. 
Because of their size, the only other species to attack dugongs are sharks, the Saltwater Crocodile and killer whales.

The British Library (BL) is the national library of the United Kingdom. It is on the north side of Euston Road in St Pancras, London, between Euston railway station and St Pancras railway station. The Library is a public institution and is one of the world's largest research libraries. Since 2000 the Chief Executive of the British Library has been Lynne Brindley.
The British Library contains over 150 million items in every language that is known. It has around 25 million books, more than any other library except the American Library of Congress. It has manuscripts and historical items dating back as far as 300 BC. There are books, journals, newspapers, magazines, sound and music recordings, patents, databases, maps, stamps, prints, drawings and much more. 
The British Library, by the law of the United Kingdom, receives copies of every book that is published in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, including all foreign books that are sold in the UK. It also buys many books which are only published outside Britain and Ireland. The British Library adds about three million items to its collection every year. The British Library has about 388 miles (625 km) of shelves. 
The British Library, before it got its present name, started out as a group of collections made by several people in the 18th century and then given as part of a national library. The collectors were King George III, Sir Robert Cotton, Sir Hans Sloane, and Robert Harley. The national library was part of the British Museum and was kept at various places, with some of the most important items always being on public display in the museum. 
The British Library was created in 1973 by the "British Library Act 1972". Since 1997 the main collection has been housed in a single new building on Euston Road next to St. Pancras railway station. In the middle of the building is a four-storey glass tower containing the ‘’King's Library’’, with 65,000 printed volumes along with other pamphlets, manuscripts and maps collected by King George III between 1763 and 1820. 
Not all of the collection is kept in this new building. Part of the collection is at the Document Supply Centre in Yorkshire and all the newspapers from before 1800 are kept at the newspaper library at Colindale, north-west London.
In December 2009 a new storage building at Boston Spa was opened. It cost £26million and will house seven million items, stored in more than 140,000 bar-coded containers, which are retrieved by robots, from the 262 kilometres of temperature- and humidity-controlled storage space.

Disk image

A disk image is a single computer file containing the complete contents of a device that contains data, such as a hard drive, tape drives, floppy disk, CD/DVD/BD/ and key drive. 
A disk image file (or simply a disk image) is an exact binary copy of an entire disk or drive. Disk image files contain ALL the data stored on the source drive including not only its files and folders but also its boot sectors, file allocation tables, volume attributes and any other system-specific data. Actually, a disk image is not a collection of files or folders but is an exact duplicate of the raw data of the original disk, sector by sector.

John Dankworth

Sir John Dankworth, CBE (20 September 1927 - 6 February 2010), was an English jazz composer, saxophonist and clarinetist. He was widely thought of as Britain's most famous jazz musician. He had a very big influence in the development of jazz in Britain. He composed film music and several television theme tunes such as "The Avengers" and "Tomorrow's World". In his early career he was known as Johnny Dankworth He was the husband of jazz singer Cleo Laine. 
John Dankworth was born in Woodford and grew up in Highams Park, Essex. His father was a sales manager who worked for an electrical engineering firm. John soon found that he loved jazz. He played the clarinet in a jazz band when he was still at school.
In 1944 he went to study music at the Royal Academy of Music. He was playing the saxophone, too, but kept this a secret because jazz was not thought to be suitable for study at the RAM. 
When Dankworth did his National Service with the army, he often played in the army dance bands. He then got a job playing jazz on the Queen Mary which sailed regularly over the Atlantic Ocean to New York. In America he heard some of the greatest jazz players, especially Charlie Parker who played bebop.
Back in Britain Dankworth took many jobs to get experience playing in jazz bands. He was a member of a group called Club Eleven which played together for several years. He also formed a band called Johnny Dankworth Seven, who played bebop in the style of Miles Davis. They started to get well-known, and in 1951 were joined by a young singer called Cleo Laine.
In 1953 the band broke up and Dankworth formed his first big band. It had eight brass instruments, five saxophones, a rhythm section and vocalists. The group was redesigned in 1956 when he put in a group of soloists instead of the saxophones. They often played on the radio and brought in guest artists who were not necessarily jazz musicians, e.g. the clarinettist Jack Brymer and the violinist Kenneth Essex as well as the music comedian and cartoonist Gerard Hoffnung.
In 1960 he gave up playing in the band to spend more time on composition. He wrote some very successful film music, e.g. "The Servant", "Darling", "Modesty Blaise" and "Morgan, A Suitable Case for Treatment". He wrote the television theme for "The Avengers" and "Tomorrow’s World", as well as lots of music for television adverts. He composed a musical version of "Lysistrata" together with Benny Green for the Bath Festival.
In 1958 he married Laine. He wrote many songs for her and played the beautiful accompaniments, often on the clarinet.
In 1969 they built a concert hall called "The Stables" in their garden in Wavendon in Milton Keynes. It became an important centre for concerts, educational programmes and cultural events.
Dankworth and Laine have two children: Alec who is a double bass player and Jacqui who is a singer. John formed a band which included Alec playing the double bass.
Dankworth set up scholarships for young musicians and often worked with young people. He encouraged educational work at "The Stables". He continued to work hard until shortly before his death.
Dankworth died in hospital in London on 6 February 2010. His death was announced a few hours later by Laine, who spoke to the audience at the end of a concert in "The Stables". She had told the performers before the concert began. She wanted the concert to be a celebration of his life. Alec and Jacqui were both performing in the show.
Dankworth was made a CBE in 1974 and was given a knighthood in 2006.

Child abandonment

Child abandonment is when a parent leaves their child. There are many causes of child abandonment, including poverty or mental illness. In many countries, if a children are abandoned, they become orphans and live in an orphanage. They are raised there until they reach 18.
In the United States, "Safe Haven Laws" allow parents to leave their infants at certain safe places. The goal of these laws is to keep parents from leaving their infants in unsafe places, or killing them. In some states, leaving a baby at a Safe Haven is thought of as child abandonment, and a complaint may be filed in family court. But as long as the baby has not been hurt, the parents cannot be charged with a crime for leaving their baby at a Safe Haven. The baby is given to state child protection workers, who find a safe place for the baby and try to get him or her adopted. Hospitals, fire stations, and police stations are common Safe Havens.
Abandonment (or exposure) was a widely used method of getting rid of babies that parents did not want. Babies would be left outside, often in a pot or a vase, to die. It was practiced in ancient times, especially in Athens. The babies at the most risk were girls; babies with physical disabilities; ugly babies; children born to poor families; and babies who looked unwell. Women had no say in whether their babies were left to die. The fathers were the only ones who had a say.

The Parazoa are an ancestral subkingdom of animals, literally translated as "beside the animals". Parazoans differ from their choanoflagellate ancestors in that they are macroscopic and have differentiated cells, but unlike "true animals" (Eumetazoa), they do not have tissues. The only surviving parazoans are the sponges, which belong to the phylum Porifera. Some include Placozoa, a phylum that consists of only one species, "Trichoplax adhaerens", in the division, but they are also sometimes placed in the subkingdom Agnotozoa.

We do not have a theory of everything. It is a hope for the future. The basic concept of the theory of everything is that one theory could explain every aspect of physics. The four basic forces of nature are gravity, the strong force, the weak force, and the electromagnetic force. The theory of general relativity explains gravity, and quantum mechanics explains the other three forces. Right now, no one theory that everyone accepts can explain all four forces. 
String theory is a theory that could become the "theory of everything".

Linguistic reduction

Linguistic reductions are lost sounds in words. This happens in spoken English. For instance, "going to" changes to "gonna". The most widely known reductions are contractions. Most contractions are reductions of 'not'. For instance, "cannot" becomes "can't". Many contractions are reductions between a subject and a verb. For instance, "He is..." becomes "He's..."
Some reductions are well known to language learners; for instance the reduction of a verb and "to". Examples are "going to" becoming "gonna" and "want to" becoming "wanna".
Linguistic reductions are part of natural English. They cannot be considered slang, or improper.
There are several basic categories of reductions:

A random sample is a sample taken at random from a population of data. 
In a random sample every element in the population has an equal chance of being selected. For instance, to do an election poll, calling people randomly out of the phone book would be better than asking people at a labor union meeting or at a small business convention. A page of the phone book is a more random sample of voters than a union meeting, so the result is more likely to tell who will really be elected. But neither sample is really random because for one thing, some people do not have phones.

Urban contemporary

Urban contemporary or urban music is a kind of music played on the radio. It comes from cities. The first person to use this word was the now dead New York DJ Frankie Crocker in the mid 1970s. Urban contemporary radio stations play only hip hop/rap, contemporary R&B, more urban-styled pop, and on occasion, Caribbean music such as reggae and reggaeton. Urban contemporary came from R&B and Soul. Almost all Urban contemporary type radio stations are found in cities that have lots of African-American people. Some cities that have Urban contemporary stations are; Los Angeles, California, New York City, Atlanta, Georgia, Chicago, Fayetteville, North Carolina, Charlotte, and Norfolk, Virginia, etc.
The words "urban contemporary" make people think of African American music, like R&B. For Latino people, the music is more like music from Latin neighborhoods, such as Reggaeton, Hip hop from South America, or bachata.
These stations try to sell their music to African-Americans between the ages of 18 and 34. Their playlists are mainly singles by popular hip hop and R&B artists. Sometimes, an urban contemporary station will play classic soul music songs from the '70s and early '80s to make old people happy.
Some radio stations in cities, like KJLH, KMEL, KDAY, and WVEE, will play gospel and Christian R&B/hip-hop music on Sundays.

State Senator

A state senator is a member of a state's Senate, the upper house in the bicameral legislature of 49 U.S. states, or a legislator in Nebraska's one house State Legislature.
There are usually fewer state senators than there are members in a state's lower house. In the past, this meant that senators represented different regions within a state, not according to the population of the region. This was a way of balancing the power of the lower house, where the numbers for each state were related to the state's population. In 1963, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that state legislatures must give seats in both houses depending on the population of the state.

Bicameral

A Bicameral system of government is one where there are two legislative or parliamentary chambers. The word comes from the Latin "bi" (meaning two) and "camera" (meaning chamber). In most cases they have different numbers of members. The smaller legislature is often called the "upper house" or "senate" and the larger is called the "lower house", and sometimes also called by another name such as "assembly" or "commons". For legislation to be passed, bicameral legislatures normally need a majority of members of both chambers to vote for the legislation.
Experts sometimes point out that often deadlocks occur in this kind of system. This can make it harder to pass laws. But others point out the checks and balances this system maintains. This prevents laws from being passed that favor a certain political faction, the government or group of people.

William-Adolphe Bouguereau

William-Adolphe Bouguereau was a French painter born November 30, 1825. Bouguereau was a traditionalist and his style did not change much throughout his painting career. He was a popular artist in his day. Rich customers liked his photo-realistic style. He liked to paint classical scenes and scenes from ancient mythology.
As a boy Bouguereau was born into a family of wine and olive oil sellers. His parents wanted him to join the family business when he became an adult. His uncle, however, arranged for him to get a proper education at school. Bouguereau showed great talent for art. One of his father’s customers talked him into sending William to a famous art college. There he won first place for one of his paintings. To earn extra money he designed labels for fruit jellies and jams.
Bouguereau liked to paint pictures of women. He was known for being able to make his subject look prettier than she really was. 
In 1856, he married Marie-Nelly Monchablon and had five children. In the late 1850s he made a profitable friendship with a successful art dealer. This art dealer made William famous even in other countries. William was able to buy a big house and studio with his growing fortune.
He was a hard working painter. He would make a thorough study and sketch of what he planned to paint. The great way he painted skin, hands and feet was well known. He eventually became a teacher at a French art college. 
Near the end of his life he described his love of his art: “Each day I go to my studio full of joy; in the evening when obliged to stop because of darkness I can scarcely wait for the next morning to come…if I cannot give myself to my dear painting I am miserable”. He painted eight hundred and twenty-six paintings.
Bouguereau died at the age of 79 on August 19, 1905 from heart disease.

Carrot cake is a sweet and moist spice cake, full of cut carrots and toasted nuts, and covered in cream cheese icing. One part of the cake is that the orange flakes of cut carrot give the cake color and texture, along with sweetness and moisture.
Carrot cake more closely is a quick bread in method of preparation. All the wet ingredients, such as the eggs and sugar, are mixed together. Then, all the dry ingredients are mixed together, and the wet are then added to the dry. Many carrot cake recipes have optional ingredients, such as nuts, raisins, pineapple, or coconut.
Carrot cake may be eaten plain, but it is commonly either glazed or covered with white icing or cream cheese icing and walnuts, often cut. Often they are decorated with frosting or marzipan made to look like carrots. They are popular in loaf, sheet cake and cupcake form, and (in the United Kingdom as well as North America) can be found pre-packaged at grocery stores, and fresh at bakeries. Some carrot cakes are even layered.

Rann of Kutch

Rann of Kutch (Urdu:رن کچھ) is a large area of Salt marshes located in mostly in Gujarat (primarily the Kutch District), Republic of India and the southern tip of Sindh province, Pakistan. It is divided into two main parts; Great Rann of Kutch and Little Rann of Kutch. It is entirely claimed by Pakistan as part of Sindh. It is about in size and is reputed to be the largest salt desert in the world. The Rann of Kachchh is the Homeland of the Kutchi people.
The Rann of Kachchh is located in the Thar Desert bio-geographic area in Gujarat with some parts in Pakistani province of Sindh. It is a seasonally marshy region, the word "Rann" meaning "salt marsh", alternating with "medaks", elevated pieces of land where vegetation grows. 
Kachchh is the name of the District currently in Gujarat (Western India), but as part of Sindh where this region is situated. The Marsh covers a huge area of around 10,000 square miles and is positioned between the Gulf of Kutch and the mouth of the Indus River in southern Pakistan. To the northeast corner of the Rann of Kachchh lies the Luni River, originating in Sakastan.
This inhospitable salty lowland, rich in Natural gas, is one scene of the perennial border disputes between Bharat and Pakistan that, in April 1965, contributed to the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. Later the same year, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Harold Wilson persuaded the combatants to end hostilities and establish a Tribunal to resolve the Territorial dispute. A verdict was reached in 1968 which saw Pakistan getting 10% of its claim of . 90% was awarded to India, although India still claims 100% of the region. Tensions may spurt again if the issue one many between them is not resolved.
The Rann of Kachchh is the only large Flooded grasslands zone in the whole Indo-Malayan region of the planet.
The fact that the area has desert on one side and the sea on the other provides the Rann of Kachchh with a variety of ecosystems, including Mangroves and Desert vegetation. The grassland and deserts of the Rann of Kachchh are home to forms of wildlife that have adapted to the often harsh conditions of this vast area. These include Endemic and Endangered animal and plant species. The marsh covers an area of around . It is between the Gulf of Kutch and the mouth of the Indus River in southern Pakistan.
The region is important for Biodiversity.
The unique handicrafts of Kutch are world famous. A lot of women and young girls make their living by selling different types of embroidered cloths. The embroidery is of various styles such as Rabari, Ahir, Sindhi, Banni, Mutwa, Ari and Soof - and some styles include mirror or bead inlay.

<doc id="226792" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=226792" title="Atari 5200">
Atari 5200

The Atari 5200 SuperSystem, or simply the Atari 5200, was a video game console which came out in 1982. It was made by Atari Inc. and was supposed to replace the popular Atari 2600. Atari wanted the 5200 to compete with the Intellivision, but it competed more closely with the ColecoVision. 
The 5200 was based on Atari Inc.'s 400/800 computers. Even though the internal hardware was almost identical, the software was not. Design mistakes meant that the 5200 had problems with its use. These problems made it a poor seller.
The game's Atari 400-based design made for a design which Atari Inc. could quickly build and sell. 
While it was being designed, the Atari 5200 called the "Atari Video System X - Advanced Video Computer System." Atari protected the design with a codename, "Pam," after a female employee at Atari. A rumor said that "Pam" or "PAM" actually stood for "Personal Arcade Machine." This was because most games for the system were based on existing arcade games. Actual working "Atari Video System X" machines, whose hardware is 100% identical to the Atari 5200 do exist, but they are extremely rare. 
The first 1982 release had four controller ports, where nearly all other systems of the day had only two. The 5200 also featured a very special new controller with an analog joystick, numeric keypad, two fire buttons on both sides of the controller and game function keys for Start, Pause, and Reset. Another special thing was the first automatic TV switchbox. Older game systems which attached to a television's antenna leads required the user to slide a switch on the adapter by hand. This RF box was also where the game's power supply connected in a unique dual power/television signal setup similar to the RCA Studio II's. A single cable coming out of the 5200 plugged into the switch box and was used for both electricity and the television signal.
The 1983 version of the Atari 5200 has two controller ports instead of four. Atari changed back to the a simpler separate power supply and manual RF switch. It also had changes in the cartridge port to allow for the Atari 2600 adapter released that year. While the adapter was only made to work on the two-port version, modifications can be made to the four-port to make it compatible. In fact, towards the end of the four-port model's production run, there were a limited number of consoles produced which included these modifications. These consoles can be identified by an asterisk in their serial number.
The prototypes used to design the controller's electrical systems used a so-called "yoke and gimbal" taken from a radio control system used to fly model airplanes. This simple design gave very nice control and was highly reliable. The actual controllers sold with the game were quite different and a great disappointment to the development teams. The design of the analog joystick, which used a weak rubber boot rather than springs to center the stick, proved to be hard to use and unreliable. Another major flaw of the controllers was that the design did not provide smooth control through the travel of the stick. This made controlling games awkward. The controllers did, however, include a pause button. This was a novelty at the time, but would become standard on almost all future game systems. Replacement joysticks were also released by other manufacturers.
Atari Inc. released the Pro-Line Trak-Ball controller for the system, which was used for titles such as "Centipede" or "Defender". A paddle controller and an updated self-centering version of the original controller were also being worked on, but never made it to market.
The controller was ranked the 10th worst video game controller by IGN editor Craig Harris.
Although the Atari 5200's insides were very much like that of the 400/800 home computers, the differences were enough so that games designed for one would not run directly on the other.
One of the most obvious differences was the 5200's lack of a keyboard. However, there were several others:
Atari Corp.'s later XE Games System revisited the idea of a console based on the 400/800 hardware. However, as this was essentially just a 65XE computer with a keyboard which could be removed, it was able to run most of the home computer titles directly.
The Atari 5200 could not run software for the still-popular Atari 2600. An adapter was later released in 1983 allowing it to play all Atari 2600 games, using the more reliable controllers from the 2600. 
Another problem was the lack of attention that Atari Inc. gave to the console; most of its attention went to the older Atari 2600. It faced an uphill battle competing with the ColecoVision's head start and a video game market which was beginning to fade.
At one point, Atari Inc. planned on developing a smaller, less expensive version of the Atari 5200 which would have gotten rid of the controller storage bin. Code-named the "Atari 5100" (a.k.a. "Atari 5200 Jr."), only a few fully-working prototype Atari 5100s were made before the project was canceled.
On May 21, 1984, during a press conference at which the Atari 7800 was introduced, company executives revealed that the 5200 had been discontinued. Total sales of the 5200 were reportedly in excess of 1 million units.

Ante Pavelić

Ante Pavelić (14 July 1889 – 28 December 1959) was the founding member of the Croatian national socialist/fascist Ustaše movement and terrorist organization in the 1930s. Later, during World War II, he will be the leader ("Poglavnik" - Head) of the Independent State of Croatia, a puppet state of Nazi Germany.
Ante Pavelić was born in Bradina, a small village roughly 15 kilometres south west of Hadžići in Bosnia and Herzegovina, then Austria-Hungary, although he draws his roots from southern Lika, in the small town of Krivi Put on the central part of the Velebit plain. His parents moved to Bosnia. As an adult, Ante Pavelić decided to move to Zagreb to study the law. An extremist even in his youth, he became a member of the organization known as the "Frankovci" whose founder, Dr. Josip Frank, was the father-in-law of Slavko Kvaternik, an Austro-Hungarian army officer. In 1919 he was the interim secretary of the Pure Party of Rights. In 1921 he was arrested along with several other members of the party but was released; he defended them at the trial and lost. Kvaternik had long been a strong advocate of Croat separatism and the German ideas on a separate Croat state found in him a ready tool.
Pavelić's quarrelsome nature became more and more apparent in the years immediately after the first war when he became involved in one dispute after another with the Centralist Party and the Croat Peasant Party of Radić. He was the sole representative of his Party in the "Skupština" (Yugoslav Parliament) but rarely attended sessions and, when he did, he sulked in his seat and only occasionally indulged in a long harangue in protest against some measure which he did not approve.
In the early 1920s, Pavelić began to establish his contacts with Croat émigrées in Vienna and Budapest and later entered into close accord with the Macedonian terrorist society IMRO. In 1927 he acted as counsel for the defense of the Macedonian terrorists at the Skopje trials. 
In 1927 he was elected to the Zagreb city council. He held the position of the party secretary in the Party of Rights until 1929 and the beginning of royal government in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Shortly after the proclamation of the establishment of the government Alexander I of Yugoslavia in January 1929, Pavelić fled abroad and was subsequently sentenced to death in absentia at Belgrade for his part in anti-Serb demonstrations organized at Sofia by Bulgarian and Macedonian terrorists. He then co-founded the Ustaše terrorist organization and went underground. 
Camps for training terrorists and saboteurs were set up in Italy and Hungary, chiefly at Brescia and Borgotaro in Italy and Janka Puszta in Hungary and an armed insurrection was attempted in 1933 when the Ustaše, armed by the Italians, attempted to invade the country by crossing the Adriatic sea in motorboats. This was unsuccessful but its lack of success probably was instrumental in the decision to assassinate King Alexander I of Yugoslavia. Two attempts were made, the last one successful and Aleksandar was slain at Marseilles 9 October 1934 along with the French Foreign Minister, Louis Barthou.
The singular lack of armed protection afforded to the Yugoslav monarch, and the general laxity of security precautions when it was well-known that one attempt had already been made on Alexander's life are grim tributes to Pavelić organizational abilities; he had apparently been able to bribe a high official in the Surete General. The Prefect of Police of Marseilles, Jouhannaud, was subsequently removed from office.
Pavelić remained in Italy until the beginning of World War II. As the leader of the Ustaše he directly ordered, organized and conducted a campaign of terror against Serbs, Jews, Gypsies, and communist Croats. The extent of this campaign reached the proportions of genocide. Pavelić's Ustaše regime was the most murderous Nazi puppet state in the whole of occupied Europe. Numerous surviving testimonies from the Nuremberg Trials and the German and the Italian war archives bear witness to bestialities perpetrated against the civilian population of the state. According to these testimonies, the German officers themselves were horrified by the scenes of atrocities committed by his Ustaše, forcing them to stop the bloodshed (Jasenovac, 1941), arrest one of the most notorious Ustaše (Fra Miroslav Filipović-Majstorović, Banja Luka, 1942) and disarm an Ustaše detachment (Eastern Bosnia, 1942). 
These atrocities were recorded in novelistic literature and poetry: Malaparte's Kaputt "Basket of oysters chapter", inspired by the widespread practices of the Ustaše gouging out the eyes of Serbs; Kovačić's "Jama (The Pit)", where Ustaše tied Serbs with barbed wire and dropped them into pits; Oljača's "Kozara"; Svetina's "Volčiči (The Wolf Puppies)". As far as the Serb population of the puppet state was concerned, the stated aim was the extermination of a third of their numbers, exile for another third, and a forced conversion to Catholicism for yet another. The Ustaše succeeded in reaching their first goal, exterminating close to one third of the Serbs and possibly more. A Gestapo report to Himmler (17 February 1942) on increased Partisan activities stated that "Increased activity of the bands is chiefly due to atrocities carried out by Ustasha units in Croatia against the Orthodox population. The Ustashas committed their deeds in a bestial manner not only against males of conscript age, but especially against helpless old people, women and children. The number of the Orthodox that the Croats have massacred and sadistically tortured to death is about three hundred thousand." 
Pavelić's regime was not officially recognized by the Vatican, but at no point did the Church condemn the genocide and forced conversions to Catholicism perpetrated by the Ustaše. Soon after coming to power in April 1941 Pavelić was given a private audience in Rome by Pope Pius XII, an act for which the Pope was widely criticized. A British Foreign Office memo on the subject described Pius as "the greatest moral coward of our age" for receiving Pavelić. Pavelic remained Hitler's servant to the end of war. His servitude toward Hitler was described by A. Veesenmayer
What Pavelic meant by "independence" he explained to German foreign minister Ribentrop's trusted troubleshooter for the southeast Europe, Anton Veesenmeyer. Pavelic had only two wishes, Veesenmayer reported to Berlin: first to obtain German recognition of Croatia; and second, an opportunity to thank Hitler in person and promise him "to live and die for the Fuehrer".
A Yugoslavian court declared that Pavelić had been responsible for the deaths of 700,000 people during his reign.
In May 1945 Pavelić fled via Bleiburg to Austria, where he stayed for a few months before transferring to Rome, where he was hidden by members of the Roman Catholic Church (as is documented in de-classified US Intelligence documents).
Six months later, he fled to South America. Upon arriving in Argentina via the ratlines, he became a security advisor to Juan Perón. Perón issued 34,000 visas to Croatians: both the Nazi collaborators and the anti-communists that fled from the new communist government led by Josip Broz Tito.
On April 10, 1957, the 16th anniversary of the founding of the Independent State of Croatia, the 67 year old Pavelić was shot and seriously wounded by an unknown assailant in Buenos Aires. The operation was attributed to Tito's Yugoslav intelligence, although the anniversary also suggested an attempt at revenge by a Chetnik activist. Despite having a bullet in his spine, Pavelić elected not to be hospitalized. Two weeks later, the Argentine government agreed to the Tito government's request to extradite Pavelić, and he went into hiding. Although there were reports that he had fled to work for the Stroessner regime in Paraguay, Pavelić's whereabouts remained unknown until late 1959, where it was learned that he had been granted asylum in Spain. Pavelić died on 28 December 1959, at the German hospital in Madrid, reportedly from complications due to the bullet in his spine.

Protea

The Protea (giant Protea known as Protea cynaroides) is part of an ancient plant family, the Proteaceae, which had already divided into two subfamilies before the break-up of the Gondwanaland continent about 140 million years ago. Both subfamilies, the Proteoideae and the Grevilleoideae, occur mainly in the southern hemisphere. In southern Africa there are about 360 species, mainly from the subfamily Proteoideae, of which more than 330 species are confined to the Cape Foral Kingdom, between Nieuwoudtville in the northwest and Grahamstown in the east. Protea cynaroides belongs to the genus Protea, which has more than 92 species, subspecies and varieties. Other well-known genera of the Proteaceae are the Leucospermum with the brightly coloured "pincushion" flowers, Leucadendron with yellow or red-brown foliage and Serruria, of which the Serruria Florida or "Blushing Bride" with its pale pink flowers is widely used in bridal bouquets. Plants in the subfamily Grevilleoideae occur mainly in Australia. The Protea (Protea cynaroides) is the national flower of South Africa.
The variety in plant size, habit, flower size and colour of the genus Protea was the reason it was named after the Greek god Proteus, who could change his shape at will. The flower bud of Protea cynaroides looks remarkably like the globe artichoke vegetable with the Latin name of Cynara scolymus and this led the botanist Linnaeus to give it the species name cynaroides.
The protea can grow only after a fire. As a simple explanation, it is because the head of this national flower has seeds inside, which can stay tightly sealed in a hard shell for almost 20 years. The shell does not open until it becomes scorched and the fire is all over. The light, fluffy seeds are then blown to the ground by the wind, where they all begin to grow again.

Air pollution

Air pollution is the pollution of air by smoke and harmful gasses, mainly oxides of carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen.
Many of the world's large cities today have bad air quality. Even 2,000 years ago, the Romans were complaining about the bad air in their cities. At that time, the air was thick with smoke from fires and the smell of sewers. Air pollution has been a danger to human health and Earth's many ecosystems for a long time.
It has many "pollutants" (things that pollute the air) from natural sources. These pollutants include dust, sea salt, volcanic ashes and gases, smoke from forest fires, pollen, and many other materials. In fact, there are many more natural pollutants than pollutants that humans make. However, humans have adapted to most of these natural pollutants.
It may be personal, occupational or community air pollution.
Air pollution is usually described as either "primary pollutants" or "secondary pollutants". Primary pollutants are pollutants that are put directly into the air by humans or natural sources. Examples of primary pollutants are exhaust fumes (gas) from cars, soot from smoke, dust storms and ash from volcanic eruptions (as seen in the picture on the left).
Secondary pollutants are pollutants that are made from chemical reactions when pollutants mix with other primary pollutants or natural substances like water vapor. Many secondary pollutants are made when a primary pollutant reacts with sunlight. Ozone and smog are secondary pollutants. Ozone is a gas that stops harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun. When it is near the ground, though, it can poison people and other organisms.
Human-made air pollution comes from many things. Most air pollution made by humans today is because of transportation. Cars, for instance, make about 60% of the human-made air pollution. The gases inside car exhaust, like nitrogen oxide, make smog and acid rain.
Human-made air pollution is also caused when humans set their farmlands or forest on wildfires producing soot ( a black powder composed mainly of carbon, produced when coal, grasses, wood etc. is burned ) from smoke, that can affect people and other living when exposed to the atmosphere.
Many industrial power plants burn fossil fuels to get their energy. However, burning fossil fuels can make a lot of oxides (chemical compounds that have oxygen and other elements inside). In fact, the burning of fossil fuels makes 96% of the sulfur oxides in the atmosphere. Some industries also make chemicals that make poisonous fumes (smoke).
Air pollution is not only on the outside. Homes, schools, and buildings can also have air pollution. Sometimes the air inside a building is even worse than the air outside. Many things which humans use every day can pollute the air. Compounds inside carpets, paints, building materials and furniture also pollute the air, especially when they are new.
In buildings where the windows are tightly shut to stop air leaks, the air inside can be polluted more than the air outside.
Acid precipitation is precipitation, like rain, sleet, or snow, that contains acids from air pollution. When fossil fuels are burned, they let out oxides into the air. When these oxides mix with water in the atmosphere, they make acid, which fall as precipitation. Acid precipitation can kill living things like fish and trees, by making the place where they live too acidic. Acid rain can also damage buildings made of limestone and concrete.
Other global concerns because of air pollution include the greenhouse gases and the hole in the ozone layer in the stratosphere. The Earth's ozone layer is supposed to protect people from the Sun's harmful ultraviolet rays, but in the 1970s, scientists found out that some chemicals let out into the atmosphere makes the ozone turn into oxygen, which means that more ultraviolet rays reach the Earth. During the 1980s, scientists found that the ozone layer above the South Pole had thinned by 50 to 98 percent.
On March 17, 1992, in Mexico City, all children under the age of 14 could not go to school because of air pollution. This does not often happen, but being exposed to air pollution every day can make people have many health problems. Children, elderly (old) people, and people with allergies especially, can have a lot of problems because of air pollution. Studies from the University of Birmingham showed that deaths because of pneumonia and air pollution from motor vehicles like cars are related.
The World Health Organization said that 2.4 million people died because of the direct problems of air pollution. Some of the problems include:
In India in 2014, it was reported that air pollution had cut crop yields in the most affected areas by almost half in 2010 when compared to 1980 levels. There can also be increased yield of crops due to some air quality conditions.

Ante Starčević

Ante Starčević (23 May, 1823 - 28 February, 1896) was a Croatian politician and publisher. 
Starčević was born in Žitnik near Gospić, a small town of the Military Frontiers, in what was then part of Austria-Hungary. He was the son of a Serb Orthodox mother and Catholic father. In 1845, he graduated from the comprehensive secondary school in Zagreb. He started his studies at the seminary in Senj, but moved to Pest in the year of 1845 in order to attend a Roman Catholic theological seminary - which he finished in 1848. After passing a number of philosophy and free sciences classes, he earned a honoris causa degree in the year of 1846. Starčević immediately returned to Croatia and continued studying theology in Senj. Rather than becoming a priest, he decided to engage in secular pursuits and started working in the law firm of Ladislav Šram in Zagreb. 
He then tried to get an academic post with the University of Zagreb. As he was unsuccessful, he remained in Šram's office until 1861 although he was banned from practicing law in 1857. He was also a member of the committee of Matica ilirska, a Croatian cultural society, in the Historical Society and in the editorial board of "Neven", a literary magazine. 
In 1861, he was appointed the chief notary of the Fiume county. That same year, he was elected to the Croatian Parliament as the representative of Fiume and founded the Croatian Party of Rights with Eugen Kvaternik. Starčević would be reelected to the parliament in 1865, 1871, and from 1878 to his death. 
In 1862, when Fiume was the scene of protests against Austrian Empire, he was suspended and sentenced to one month in prison as an enemy of the regime. When he was released, Starčević returned to Šram's office, where he remained until 11 October 1871, when he was arrested again, this time on the occasion of the Rakovica Revolt. The revolt was launched by Kvaternik, who was not a Serb hater as his political comrade Starčević. Kvaternik had become convinced that a political solution, as Starčević called for, was not possible. While the revolt drew several hundred men, both Croats and Serbs, it was soon crushed by Imperial Austrian troops. The Croatian Party of Rights was abolished. Starčević was released after two months in prison. 
In his old age, he moved to Starčević House ("Starčevićev dom"), built for him by the Party of Rights in 1895. He died in his house a year later, when he was 73. According to his wish, he was buried in the Church of St Mirko in the Zagreb suburb of Šestine. His bust was made by Ivan Rendić. At his deathbed, he requested that no monuments be raised to his honor, but his statue was put up in front of Starčević House in 1998.
After being banned from practicing law in 1857, Starčević travelled to Russia where he hoped he would gather support from the empire's eastern rival. When this failed, he travelled to France, pinning his hopes on French emperor Napoleon III. While in Paris, he published his work "La Croatie et la confédération italienne", considered by some to be the precursor to his Party of Rights' political program. In 1859, the Austrian Empire was defeated in the Second Italian War of Independence, during which time Starčević returned to Croatia. Austria lost control over Italy, and Austria's weakening status in the world paved the way for Starčević's career. 
As the chief notary in Fiume in 1861, Starčević wrote "the four petitions of the Rijeka county", which are considered the basis of the political program of the Croatian Party of Rights. He pointed out that Croatia needed to determine its relationships with Austria and Hungary through international agreements. He demanded the reintegration of the Croatian lands, "the large kingdom of Croatia of old" (the Middle Age's Kingdom of Croatia), the homeland of one people, "with the same blood, language, past and (God willing) future".
On that ideological basis, he founded the Croatian Party of Rights with his school friend Eugen Kvaternik in 1861. The Party of Rights was clerical, conservative, and pro-Habsburg. Its only concession to nationalism was hostility to the Serbs who, since the incorporation of the "military frontiers" into Croatia in 1868, made up a quarter of the population. Starčević was the only parliamentary representative who agreed with Kvaternik's draft constitution of 26 June 1861. He advocated the termination of the Military Frontier and persuaded parliament to pass on 5 August 1861 the decision annulling any joint business with Austria.
He advocated the resolution of Bosnian issues by reforms and cooperation between the people and the nobility. Starčević believed that Bosniaks were the "the best Croats", and claimed that "Bosnian Muslims are a part of the Croatian people and of the purest Croatian blood".
Starčević wrote literary criticism, short stories, newspaper articles, philosophical essays, plays and political satire. He was also a translator.
His travelogue "From Lika" was published in Kušlan's magazine "Slavenski Jug" on 22 October 1848. He wrote four plays in the period 1851-52, but only the "Village Prophet" has been preserved. His translation of Anacreon from Ancient Greek was published in "Danica" in 1853. His critical review (1855) of Đurđević's "Pjesni razlike" was described by the Croatian literary historian Branko Vodnik as "our first genuine literary essay about older Dubrovnik literature". His opus shows an affinity with practical philosophy, which he calls "the science of life". As Josip Horvat said: "His literary work from 1849 to the end of 1853 made Ante Starčević the most prolific and original Croatian writer along with Mirko Bogović."
In 1850, incited by Ljudevit Gaj, Starčević started working on the manuscript of "Istarski razvod", a crucial Croatian document from 1325. He transcribed the text from the Glagolitic alphabet to the Latin alphabet, analyzed it and published it in 1852. In the foreword, young Starčević elaborated his linguistic ideas, pointing out that the mixture of all three Croatian dialects (Shtokavian, Chakavian) and Kajkavian) and the Krajina dialect is called the Croatian language, which Starčević considers from the perspective of its six hundred years of history. Starčević accepted the etymological orthography and used the ekavian form for his entire life, considering it the heir of the old Kajkavian. His language is a "synthetic" form of Croatian, never used before or after him, most similar to the Ozalj idiom of Petar Zrinski, whom he probably never read. 
In that period, in the "Call for Subscriptions to the Croatian Grammar" (8 December, 1851) he stated his opposition to the Vienna Language Agreement of 1850 and the linguistic concept of Vuk Stefanović Karadžić. He continued his dispute with the followers of Karadžić in a series of articles published in 1852. His opposition to the Vuk's work he 'supported' by utter denial of the Serbs as the nation, their language, their culture and history. In his vain and racistic effors to oppose and derail Karadžić's work, he was loner and loser - mainstream of the Croatian educated men, headed by Strossmayer and Gaj, highly appreciated and supported Karadžić. It was demonstrated publicly immediately after Karadžić's death - when Croatian Parliament (Sabor) collected a considerable amount of money in order to erect a monument to honor Karadžić in Croatia and the Court chanchellor Ivan Mažuranić got the Viennese Imperial Court to financially support the Karadžić' widow.
When "Srbski dnevnik" from Novi Sad published an article saying that "Croatians write in Serbian", Starčević wrote a fierce reply: "(...) Instead of claiming that the Croats use anything else but the Croatian language, those writers who consider themselves Serbs (or whatever they like) would do well to write in the educated and pure Croatian language, like some of them are already doing, and they can call their language Coptic for all I care. (...)" He published the reply as an unsigned article in "Narodne novine", the newspaper of Ljudevit Gaj, so the Serbian side attacked Gaj, wrongly attributing the article to him. Starčević subsequently proclaimed he was the author, but Gaj, who cared to maintain good relations with Serbia, distanced himself from his friend.
For his political activity and literary work, Starčević is commonly called Father of the Nation ("Otac domovine") in Croatia. His portrait is depicted on the obverse of the Croatian 1000 Croatian kuna banknote, issued in 1993.
Starčević was a racist and an anti-Semite. His understanding of the basic human rights and the way he linked them to the civil liberties were extremely primitive and selective. For example, Starčević criticized the socialism as ""unshaped"" and he was delighted by the colonialism and claimed that ""Algeria should be densely populated by a few million of happy Frenchmen and not to allow to have one hundred fifty thousand of them against two and half million of Arabs"".
Starčević had based his ideological views on writings of those ancient Greek writers who thought that some people, by their very nature, are slaves, for they had ""just half of the human mind"" and, for that reason, they ""shall be governed by people of the human nature"". About the people and nations which he saw as cursed and lower ranked races - he spoke as of the animal breeds and uses the "breed" word to mark them.
He wrote a whole tract about the Jews that could be summarized in a few sentences: ""Jews ... are the breed, except a few, without any morality and without any homeland, the breed of which every unit strives to its personal gain, or to its relatives' gain. To let the Jews to participate in public life is dangerous: throw a piece of mud in a glass of the clearest water - then all the water will be puddled. That way the Jews spoiled and poisoned the French people too much"".
But, for Starčević, there was a race worse than the Jews. For him, the ""Slavoserb"" notion was firstly of a political nature: the ""Slavoserbs"" are his political opponents who ""sold themselves to a foreign rule"". Then all those who favorably look on the South Slavs unity not regarding them (the South Slavs) as the Croats.
Later, and with years, Starčević more and more marked the ""Slavoserbs"" as a separate ethnic group, or - as he used to say the ""breed"", ranked, as humans, lower than the Jews: ""The Jews are less harmful than the Slavoserbs. For the Jews care for themselves and their people ... but the Slavoserbs are always for the evil: if they cannot gain a benefit, then they tend to harm the good or just affair, or to harm those who are for the affair."" - he wrote once.
Further, he claimed that the injustice was done to different ""cursed breeds"" what spoiled those breeds even more and made them ""to be vengeful against their oppressors"". As a convinced racist, he stresses that to the ""cursed breeds"", i.e. to the lower races should not be given any role in the public life.
As an aged man, he makes the Serbs identical to the ""Slavoserb breed"" and mocks them for their defeats they suffered long ago - which provoked negative reactions even in his ""Party of Rights"". On that occasion, the Party member Erazmo Barčić (1894.) described Starčević's mockery and racism as ""throwing mud at people and primitive cheeky invectives"".
However, when once face with negative reactions to his open racism, he temporarily retreated. That was a reason that he wrote an article in Sloboda, issue of 23 March, 1883: "The main thing is this: everybody should work for the people and the homeland, and let them call themselves as they wish... We have disputes and dissensions only because they are supported and strengthened from the outside... We believe that hungry and cold Serbs and Croats feel the same... Therefore, everybody can assume the name of Hottentots, every person can choose their own name, as long as we are all free and happy!..."
The British historian A.P.J.Taylor wrote (pages 188-189):
Starčević's racism was further fully elaborated by Ivo Pilar [under pseudonym L. von Südland] The book was translated into Croatian language in the year of 1943, by Pavelić's regime, as one of the tenets of his Ustaše and his Independent State of Croatia. This racist work was reprinted in 1990. In the preface to this reprint edition, Dr. Vladimir Veselica, a Zagreb University professor, expresses his enthusiasm that the author had given "relevant answers" at the highest intellectual level. What thrilled him so was the consistently expressed racist hatred against the Serbs. It is sufficient to submit one quotation that explains the sense and content of this book, which far outdoes the current demonization of the Serbs: " it was not without reason that I tried to show how the Serbs today are dangerous for their ideas and their racial composition, how a bent for conspiracies, revolutions and coups is in their blood."

Think tank

A think tank is a special organization which helps other organizations and groups with problems they do not know how to solve. They do this by providing data or knowledge, and by discussing the options in detail. They get their information by doing research, and by collecting ideas and data from a wide range of sources.
The first think tank was the British Royal United Services Institute (1831), though of course the term "think tank" is much later, post World War II. Non-government institutions in the United States started early in the 20th century. The Arthur D. Little consultancy, incorporated in 1909, pioneered the idea of contracted professional services. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace was founded in 1910. The Institute for Government Research, which later merged into the Brookings Institution, was formed in 1916. Other early twentieth century organizations now classified as think tanks include the Hoover Institution (1919), and Chatham House in London (1920). The Great Depression and its aftermath spawned several economic policy organizations, such as the National Planning Association (1934) and the Committee for Economic Development (1943).
Think tanks of the modern kind started after the Second World War, in the cold war era. The RAND Corporation was started in 1946 inside the Douglas Aircraft Company, and was set up as an independent corporation in 1948. The name was taken from R&D (research and development), though in fact it did no development. The RAND used the same operations research (O.R.) methods which scientists had developed during the war. This was the application of knowledge, scientific methods and thinking to solve the new problems posed by the war. After the war, the RAND used very similar techniques, mostly based on the hard sciences like maths, physics and economics. It was and still is funded mainly by the American government.
The cold war period raised the question of how the American government might handle nuclear weapons in bargaining and negotiating with the Soviet Union. This was the speciality of Herman Kahn, a RAND staff member who set up his own think tank in 1961, called the Hudson Institute. His publications on how to think about these issues, and those of Thomas Schelling, were landmarks in the post-war history of negotiating strategy.
More recently, think tanks have specialised into particular areas of interest, such as foreign policy. Many have become advocates for political interests, doing research which can be used by public relations and lobbying groups.

Major League Baseball on FOX

Major League Baseball on FOX (or MLB on FOX) is FOX Sports's broadcast of Major League Baseball. It began on June 1, 1996 and continue through at least 2013.
Major League Baseball made a deal with FOX and NBC on November 7, 1995. FOX televised regular season games (about 16 weekly telecasts normally beginning on Memorial Day weekend) on Saturday afternoons, selected Division Series games, and alternated the All-Star Game, League Championship Series and the World Series with NBC each year. To better state this, FOX aired the All-Star Game aired American League Championship Series in odd-numbered years while airing the National League Championship Series and World Series in even-numbered years.
In September 2000, Major League Baseball and FOX signed a 6-year contract to air Saturday baseball, the All-Star Game, selected Division Series games, and exclusive coverage of the League Championship Series and the World Series.
Rumors about the end of "Major League Baseball on FOX" were laid to rest on July 11, 2006 when the network announced they would still air the World Series through the 2013 season. It was announced on October 17, 2006 that FOX would retain the All-Star Game and World Series, except they would air the regular season beginning with the first Saturday of the regular season, and postseason coverage beyond the World Series was limited to one League Championship Series a year, alternating one for the other with TBS each year, airing the other LCS.

Devil's food cake

The Devil's food cake is an old fashioned chocolate cake made of chocolate or cocoa and baking powder. It is moist, soft, rich, and very good for keeping. It is a light-textured chocolate layer-type cake with a deep reddish brown color. The cake gets this bright red color from the large amount of red food dye used in the preparation. Devil's food cake is usually thought of in terms of dark chocolate, but originally it was red. Today cooks, using modern processed cocoa, sometimes add a touch of red food coloring to bring back the authentic color.
Devil's Food Cakes can be stored in the refrigerator for about 3 days.
The Devil's Food Cake may also be called a Red velvet cake.

Partridge

The Partridge is a medium sized bird. They are known as game birds because they are hunted and eaten by humans. They are in the Pheasant family (Phasianidae).
Partridges are in the song "The Twelve Days of Christmas". The line "...and a Partridge in a pear tree" is sung.
Most partridges are brown, gray and white. They are camouflaged and difficult to see. They have short legs and short bills. Partridges are smaller than Pheasants but they are bigger than Quails.
Partridges can not fly very well and they do not migrate. This means they always stay in the same area all year round. 
Partridges live in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. They live in places such as moors, grassland and farmland. They feed mostly on seeds, and nest on the ground. This means their nests are not very safe from predators such as foxes. Partridges use their camouflage to make it difficult for predators to see them and their nests.

Graham's number

Graham's number is a very, very big natural number that was discovered by a man called Ronald Graham. Graham was solving a problem in an area of mathematics called Ramsey theory. He proved that the answer to his problem was smaller than Graham's number.
Graham's number is one of the biggest numbers ever used in a mathematical proof. Even if every digit in Graham's number was written in the tiniest writing possible, it would still be too big to fit in the observable universe.
Ramsey theory is an area of mathematics that asks questions like the following:
It turns out that for this simple problem, the answer is "yes" when we have 6 or more points, no matter how the lines are colored. But when we have 5 points or less, we can color the lines so that the answer is "no".
Graham's number comes from a variation on this question.
By asking that the 4 points lie on a plane, we have made the problem much harder. We would like to know: for what values of "n" is the answer "no" (for some way of coloring the lines), and for what values of "n" is it "yes" (for all ways of coloring the lines)? But this problem has not been completely solved yet.
In 1971, Ronald Graham and B. L. Rothschild found a partial answer to this problem. They showed that for "n"=6, the answer is "no". But when "n" is very large, as large as Graham's number or larger, the answer is "yes".
One of the reasons this partial answer is important is that it means that the answer is eventually "yes" for at least some large "n". Before 1971, we didn't know even that much.
Graham's number is not only too big to write down, it is too big even to express in scientific notation. In order to be able to write it down, we have to use Knuth's up-arrow notation.
We will write down a sequence of numbers that we will call g1, g2, g3, and so on. Each one will be used to define the next. When we get to g64, that will be Graham's number.
First, here are some examples of up-arrows:
The next step like this is formula_8 or formula_9. This is the number we will call g1.
After that, g2 is equal to formula_10; the number of arrows in this number is g1.
g3 is equal to formula_11, where the number of arrows is g2.
We keep going in this way. We stop when we define g64 to be formula_11, where the number of arrows is g63.
This is Graham's number.

Tak'alik A'baj' is an ancient ruin in Guatemala; it used to be called Abaj Takalik. It is one of several Mesoamerican sites that have Olmec and Maya features. The site was inhabited the during the Preclassic and Classic periods, from the 9th century BC through to at least the 10th century AD. It was an important place for trade. It traded with Kaminaljuyu and Chocolá. It is one of the largest sites with carved monuments on the Pacific coast. Olmec-style sculptures include a possible colossal head, rock carvings and others. The site has one of the biggest collections of Olmec-style sculpture outside of the Gulf of Mexico.
Takalik Abaj shows the first signs of Maya culture that happened by about 400 BC. The site includes a Maya royal tomb and examples of Maya writing that are among the first from the Maya region. Studies continue at the site; the monumental buildings and long tradition of sculpture in a variety of styles suggest the site was important.
Finds from the site indicate contact with the distant city of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico. They imply that Takalik Abaj was conquered by it or its allies. Takalik Abaj was linked to long-distance Maya trade routes that let the city take part in a trade network that included the Guatemalan highlands and the Pacific coastal plain from Mexico to El Salvador.
Takalik Abaj was a large city with the main buildings in four main groups spread across nine terraces. While some of these were natural, others were man-made, needing a lot of work and materials. The site had a clever water drainage system and many stone sculptures.

A Pinto horse is a spotted horse. They are not a breed, but a coat color. In fact, any horse breed can be a Pinto as long as they have patches of white or another color. Pintos are often confused with Paints, a horse breed. They look very similar. The difference is that a Paint is a breed, and a Pinto is a coat color that can be on any breed, including Paints.
Pintos are so old that they were found in tombs in Ancient Egypt dating back to 4 B.C. In the 16th century Cortez brought thousands to the New World. Some of them were set free, and Native Americans caught them. The Native Americans liked them for their toughness and their color. Their color blended in with the environment and made a natural camouflage. They were known to make great war horses. Their name came from the Spanish word "pintado", which means “painted”.
Pintos have pink skin, blue eyes, and white or multicolored hooves. They can be either a white horse with colored patches, or a colored horse with white patches. It has been said that no two Pintos are exactly alike.
Pintos have 3 different patterns:
Pintos come in 4 different types:

Hypothermia is a condition when a person is so cold that the body temperature drops below normal. Hypothermia is any body temperature lower than . Someone with hypothermia starts shivering and cannot stop. The person then becomes confused and acts strange. Their words don't make sense and they may be clumsy. Sometimes they become very tired. If someone gets hypothermia, wrap the person in blankets and take them to the hospital. If that's impossible, warm up the person slowly and give them a warm drink.
When hypothermia begins, a person feels cold, starts shivering and can't stop. The person cannot do complicated things with his or her hands. They are also unable to touch their thumb with their little finger, because their hand muscles don't work well.
Mild hypothermia is sometimes used on purpose by doctors for treating some medical problems. It takes blood away from the skin, hands and feet, and puts it to the brain and important internal organs. This helps when the person is bleeding from cuts or other wounds, and also helps when the patient goes into cardiac arrest. 
The person begins shivering very strongly. Their large muscles do not work well. They move slowly and with difficulty, growing a little confused and walking . The person becomes pale, and lips, ears, fingers, and toes might become blue. This is because the body is trying to keep the most important organs warm. The person might feel sick in their stomach and very tired, wanting to go to sleep, anywhere. 
Body temperature drops even more, but the person usually stops shivering. They cannot talk clearly; they think slowly, and they cannot move their hands. Sometimes a person will feel suddenly warm, as if they are getting better, but this just means they are getting worse. They may take off warm clothes or lay down to go to sleep. If this continues, they cannot walk or answer questions. Their pulse becomes weaker, but the heart may beat faster. Finally, the person dies.

Wáray-Wáray or Warai (commonly spelled as "Waray"; also "Winaray" or "Lineyte-Samarnon") is a language spoken in the provinces of Samar, Leyte, and Biliran in the Philippines.
The Waraynon group of languages consists of Waray, Waray Sorsogon and Masbate Sorsogon. All the Warayan languages belong to the Visayan language family and are related to Cebuano and more closely to Hiligaynon and Masbatenyo.
Waray-Waray is one of the ten officially recognized regional languages in the Philippines and used in the local government. It is spoken throughout the islands especially in the Eastern Visayas region. But it is also spoken in some parts of Mindanao, Masbate, Sorsogon and Metro Manila where Warays went to. There is also a very small number of Filipinos abroad, especially in the United States, that speaks this language.
The Waray language has sixteen consonants: . There are three main vowels: "a" , "i" , and "u" . Consonants and were once allophone but cannot interchange, like "palaron" (to be lucky) [from "palad", palm (because someone's luck is seen in the palm] but not "paladon" and "tagadiín" (from where) [from "diín", where] but not "tagariín".
Native numbers are used for numbers one through ten. From eleven onwards, Spanish numbers are exclusively used in Waray today, their native counterparts being almost unheard of by the majority of native speakers numbers (except for gatus for "hundred" and yukot for "thousand").

Taxicab number

A taxicab number is the name given by mathematicians to a series of special numbers: 2, 1729 etc. A taxicab number is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two positive cubes in "n" distinct ways. It has nothing to do with taxis, but the name comes from a well-known conversation that took place between two famous mathematicians: Godfrey Hardy and Srinivasa Ramanujan.
Godfrey Hardy was a professor of mathematics at Cambridge University. One day he went to visit a friend, the brilliant young Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, who was ill. Both men were mathematicians and liked to think about numbers. 
When Ramanujan heard that Hardy had come in a taxi he asked him what the number of the taxi was. Hardy said that it was just a boring number: 1729. Ramanujan replied that 1729 was not a boring number at all: it was a very interesting one. He explained that it was the smallest number that could be expressed by the sum of two cubes in two different ways.
This story is very famous among mathematicians. 1729 is sometimes called the “Hardy-Ramanujan number”.
There are two ways to say that 1729 is the sum of two cubes.
1x1x1=1; 12x12x12=1728. So 1+1728=1729
But also: 9x9x9=729; 10x10x10=1000. So 729+1000=1729
There are other numbers that can be shown to be the sum of two cubes in more than one way, but 1729 is the smallest of them.
Ramanujan did not actually discover this fact. It was known in 1657 by a French mathematician Bernard Frénicle de Bessy.
Since the famous conversation between Hardy and Ramanujan, mathematicians have tried to find other interesting numbers that are the smallest number that can be expressed by the sum of two cubes in three/four/five etc. different ways. These numbers are very, very big, and have been found by computers.
So far, the following six taxicab numbers are known :

Bernard Frénicle de Bessy (about 1605–1675), was a French mathematician. He was born in Paris. He wrote many papers about mathematics, number theory and combinatorics. The Frénicle standard form, a standard representation of magic squares, is named after him. He solved many problems created by Fermat. He also discovered a taxicab number and in 1693, he described all 880 essentially different normal magic squares of order 4.
Like Fermat, Frénicle was an amateur mathematician, but he wrote letters to famous people such as Descartes, Christiaan Huygens, Mersenne and also Fermat, who was his friend. He is mainly remembered for his discoveries about number theory.

Frances Burney

Frances Burney (13 June 1752 – 6 January 1840) was an English novelist, diarist and playwright. She was also known as Fanny Burney. After her marriage, she was known as Madame d’Arblay. She was born in King's Lynn, England. She was born to musician Dr Charles Burney (1726 – 1814) and Mrs Esther Sleepe Burney (1725 – 62). She mostly taught herself. She began writing what she called her "scribblings" when she was ten. Her first novel, "Evelina", was published in 1778. This novel made her very famous. "Cecilia" came out in 1782. It was an even greater critical success. Her major novels, "Evelina", "Cecilia", and "Camilla" are about a young girl. The girls are clever and beautiful, but does not have a lot of experience. The girl goes out into the world and grows in character. Her books were liked by Jane Austen. In 1786, she became Second Keeper of the Robes to Queen Charlotte. She wrote many journals and letters. Her journals and letters have interested historians. In 1793, she married a French exile, General Alexandre D'Arblay. They had a son in 1794. His name was Alexander. He was their only son. While living in France from 1802 to 1812, Burney wrote "The Wanderer". It was a novel about the French Revolution. It was published in 1814. Her last published work was the "Memoirs of Doctor Burney" (1832). She died in London in 6 January 1840. She was buried in Bath near her husband and son.
On 13 June 1752, Frances Burney was born in King's Lynn. She was baptized on the 7 of July. Her older brothers and sisters were Ester (Hetty) (1749 – 1832) and James (1750 – 1821). Her younger brothers and sisters were Susanna Elizabeth (1755-1800), Charles (1757-1817) and Charlotte Ann (1761 – 1838). Susanna Elizabeth became Frances Burney's close friend. James Burney became an admiral. He sailed with Captain James Cook on his second and third trips. The younger Charles Burney was a scholar. Her younger half-sister, Sarah Burney (1772 – 1844), also became a novelist. She published five works that she wrote herself. Esther Sleepe Burney also had two boys who died at birth.
Esther Sleepe Burney was three years older than Charles Burney. She had her oldest daughter, Esther, with Charles before they married. Frances Burney kept this as a "family secret". She even said nothing about the date of her father's marriage. Also, she did not say when his children were born in the "Memoirs". Some people have thought that she hid the dates to make everyone believe she published "Evelina" when 17.
Her mother suddenly became sick. She took a trip to Bath and Bristol Hot Wells. This is where main character in "Evelina" go to try to become healthy again. However, she did not get better. The sickness was thought to be tuberculosis. It is also possible that it was cancer. In 1760, her mother, Esther Sleepe Burney, died. She was described by historians as a gentle woman of "warmth and intelligence". It is possible that Esther Burney's French birth influenced Burney's writing. One example is the conflicts between Madame Duval and Captain Mirvan in "Evelina". It may also have been one reason for her love of and marriage to Alexandre D'Arblay. Fanny was very shocked and sad when she heard that her mother was dead. Her neighbor, Mrs. Pringle, commented. She later said, "...she never saw such affliction" and that Fanny would "take no comfort--& was almost killed with ["sic"] Crying". Her father, Charles Burney, was also very unhappy. He comforted himself with writing sad poems about his wife.
Her father was respected by many people as a musician. He was also well-educated. He wished to show that a musician could be a gentleman. Frances Burney often saw many opera singers, dancers, musicians, and actors (like actors Garrick or Christopher Smart), that spoke in many kinds of languages. She mentioned him in "Evelina": "Well may Mr. Garrick be so celebrated, so universally (everywhere) admired—I had not any idea of so great a performer...every look "speaks"!...I am afraid you will think me mad (crazy), so I won't say any more; yet I really believe Mr. Garrick would make you mad too, if you could see him." She also saw more of the world than most "young ladies" could. She wrote down many rude things people said in her diaries. Traveller Richard Twiss once embarrassed the family by talking about improper things. He said that an immodest book, "The Dictionary of Love", was very good. After Twiss left, Burney wrote in her Diary, 'Even my gentle & candid (truthful) Father says that "he has quite mistaken the Thing," & that he will never see a "Table Cloth" in his House again'.
Some people have said that Burney may have been shy because of her father. People said that Mr. Burney's only fault was "" (too much serving to men). Frances never openly her father. She even carefully destroyed everything bad about him. In her "Memoirs", she wrote that her father had no faults. However, she wrote explanations and excuses for things her father thought were right.
In October 1767, her father married a rich widow. Her name was Elizabeth Allen. She already had three sons. The Burney children did not like their stepmother. Hester, Frances's older sister, married her cousin. His name was Charles Rosseau Burney. He was a musician. She married him in September 1770. She probably did this to leave her home. Because of this, Frances lost a sister who was like another mother. The Burney children did a "secret war" with Mrs. Allen. They called her "Mrs. Precious", "Madam", and "the Lady". A letter from Frances Burney to her sister Hester said, "The excuse to be "fudged" up (made up, lied) for the purpose, I leave to your own ingenuity." Although at this time Frances was 25 years old, she had to find an excuse to visit her married sister. Even their old friend, Samuel "Daddy" Crisp, joined in with mocking Mrs. Elizabeth Allen.
Her father educated her sisters Esther and Susanna much more than Frances Burney. When she was eight, she still had not learned the alphabet. She was also so shy that visitors at her father's house called her the "old lady". Some scholars think she might have had a kind of dyslexia. Her brother used to play tricks on her by pretending to teach her to read and giving her a book upside-down. She did not find out that it was actually upside down and tried to read it. People said that "the little dunce" should be whipped. However, Esther Sleepe Burney always replied that "she had no fears about Fanny". Her sister Susanna said that Fanny has "sense, sensibility, and bashfulness (shyness)". She also added, "I am afraid...that my sister Fanny is too reserved".
In 1763 or 1764, Samuel "Daddy" Crisp became close to the Burney family. He helped Frances write by asking for many journal-letters from her about her family and her life. He influenced her writing very much.
Frances Burney d'Arblay made a new kind of English novel, recording things that happened from George III's madness to what happened after the Battle of Waterloo. She also wrote comedies that had a great influence on many writers to come. For example, Jane Austen found both the theme and the title for "Pride and Prejudice" in the last chapter of Frances Burney's novel "Cecilia". William Makepeace Thackeray, the writer of Vanity Fair, was also influenced by Burney. Her first novel, "Evelina", was a new kind of fiction in English. It was a fiction where women in society were shown in realistic, modern ways - the novel of manners. "She showed the manners and morals of polite society with a relish (liking) for the ridiculous (funny) and a respect for the conventional (traditional)".("Norton Anthology of Literature by Women", p. 242) Burney was the first woman to make the writing of novels "respectable". Her second novel, "Cecilia", published in 1782, was an even greater critical success. Her third novel, "Camilla", was very popular; the sale was "4 times that of "Evelina", & nearly double that of "Cecilia"".

Grebe

A grebe is a medium sized bird. They are in the family Podicipedidae. There are 22 species of grebe.
Most grebes are a medium or large size. Some grebes, such as the Little Grebe are smaller. All Grebes have large feet with lobed toes. This means that each toe is separate on the foot (the opposite of this is webbed feet which is seen in ducks and geese). Some grebes find it difficult to walk on land because their feet are so big. They are much better at swimming and diving in water.
Grebes have narrow wings. Some grebes find it difficult to fly. There are two species of grebe that cannot fly at all. This means that if grebes are in danger, they will dive under water instead of flying away like other birds do. 
Grebes can have long or short bills. If they eat insects in the water, they will have a short bills. If they eat crustaceans (for example, crabs) they will have a long, sharp bill. 
Most grebes are brown, white and red/orange. They have many, waterproof feathers. This means they can easily float on water and dive into water without getting cold or wet. In spring and summer, grebes have orange crests on their heads. This is so they can attract a mate. Some grebes do a mating ritual. This is when they "dance" in the water.
Grebes make their nest from plants found in the water. The nests float on top of the water. Baby grebes can swim when they are born. They are usually brown and white and do not get their orange crests until they are adults.
Grebes live in freshwater (lakes or rivers). Some species of grebe will go to saltwater (sea/ocean) when they are migrating. This is when birds fly to live in a different place in summer or winter. Grebes only migrate if they live in North America, Europe or Asia. Grebes in South America, Africa and Asia do not migrate. They are found in every continent on earth.

Funeral director

A Funeral Director also called a mortician or undertaker is a person who has the job of organizing a funeral. This often includes embalming and burial or cremation of the dead, as well as the planning and arrangement of the actual funeral ceremony. They place the body into a coffin or casket. If people are going to come and look at the body before burial, the funeral director will have the body dressed, and made up with cosmetics to make it look better.

Mangrove

Mangroves are trees or shrubs that grow in salty water in hot places like the tropics. Mangroves make a special saltwater woodland or shrubland habitat, called a "mangrove swamp", "mangrove forest", "mangrove" or "mangal". Mangroves grow on 1/3 of tropical shores. They are also found in sub-tropical Africa, Asia, and the southwest Pacific. Their twisted, tangled roots collect dirt, which often become islands.
Mangroves live right in the sea. Their seeds fall from the tree and will grow roots as soon as they touch any kind of soil. During low tide, they may fall in soil rather than water and start growing where they fell. If the water level is high, though, they can be carried far away from where they fell. Mangrove trees are often the beginning of what will one day be a small island. As dirt and other things collect in their roots, little bodies of land are formed – just the right place for other island vegetation to grow. This is an example of seed dispersal by water.
Sometimes, mangrove trees grow on a coral reef and keep them healthy. Smaller roots with air passages and breathing pores (holes) move oxygen from the air to parts of the plant underwater. Mangrove roots give clear water to the coral by trapping dirt and clean water by filtering land runoff and removing pollutants. The tree also protects the shoreline (and, through this, the coral reefs) from being eroded by storm waves. Mangrove thickets are a good place for many coral-reef fish, shrimp, and crabs to grow.

Great Crested Grebe

The Great Crested Grebe is a water bird. It is a member of the grebe family. Its scientific name is "Podiceps cristatus".
The Great Crested Grebe is a medium sized bird. It is 46–51 cm long. Its wingspan is 59–73 cm long (this is the length of both wings).
It is white and brown and it has orange crest feathers on its head. It has a long, sharp pink bill. Baby Great Crested Grebes have black and white stripes on their heads. It is similar to the stripes on a zebra.
The Great Crested Grebe is found in Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. It is the biggest grebe in Europe. It lives in freshwater lakes. It eats crustaceans (for example, crabs), insects and small frogs. It dives into the water to find food.
The Great Crested Grebe has an interesting mating ritual. This means two birds (male and female) do a "dance" in the water before they mate. Grebes dance every time the pair meets, and the dance varies according to the circumstance. Returning to the nest is different from meeting out on the water, for instance. Most dances end in a bout of head-shaking. 
The Great Crested Grebe makes a nest from plants. The nest floats on top of the water. A pair of Great Crested Grebes will usually have two eggs. When the babies are born, they cannot swim. Their parents teach them to swim and dive. Sometimes the babies will sit on their parents backs while the parents swim in the water. 
The Great Crested Grebe nearly became extinct in the United Kingdom in the 19th century. This is because people wanted to use their orange head feathers. People wanted to put the feathers on their hats and clothes. The RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) stopped this. There are now many Great Crested Grebes in the United Kingdom.

Swift

The swift is a bird in the family Apodidae. It is in the order Apodiformes with treeswifts and hummingbirds. The swift is very good at flying. It spends all of its time in the air.
The scientific name for the swift ("apus") comes from the Ancient Greek word απους, "apous" which means "without feet". This is because swifts have very small, weak feet. Swifts use their feet to hold on to vertical places (for example, the wall of a house, or a cliff). Swifts do not want to land on the ground. If they land on ground, they cannot fly up again. Some people say if you see a swift on the ground, you should pick it up and throw it up in the air so it can fly again.
Swifts are small birds. They can fly very well and very fast. Some swifts can fly at 514m per second. If a swift needs to fly very fast, it can fly at 60m per second for a short amount of time. When catching insects, they fly in a series of swoops, changing direction rapidly as they pursue the prey. 
Swifts have long, curved wings. The wings are in the same of a sickle or boomerang. They have a forked tail. This means it looks like a V shape. 
Swifts can be seen all over the world. They like to live in warmer places and they migrate every year. For example, Swifts fly to Europe in the spring and summer. When it gets cold at the start of autumn, the Swifts fly to Africa where it is warmer.
Swifts make their nests in a corner between two walls. For example, near the roof of a house, or in an area between rocks in a cave. They use mud and saliva (spit) to make a cup-shaped nest. 
There are some swifts which only use saliva to make their nests. These swifts are in the genus Aerodramus. In Asia, people take the nests and use them to make bird's nest soup. This soup is very popular in China.

Alice (song)

"Alice" is an alternative rock song written and performed by Canadian singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne for the soundtrack to the 2010 movie "Alice in Wonderland", entitled "Almost Alice". The song is a mid-tempo ballad sung from the perspective of the film's lead character, Alice. According to Lavigne, she wrote the song after asking Disney executives and director Tim Burton for a role on the soundtrack. The song was produced by Butch Walker and mixed by Lavigne's former husband Deryck Whibley.
While designing clothes inspired by "Alice in Wonderland" for her Abbey Dawn line, Lavigne told Disney executives she could write a song for the film's soundtrack. Director Tim Burton agreed, and Lavigne "wrote the song immediately" on her piano. Lavigne described the song as "a little darker" and confirmed the lyrics, "trippin' out, spinnin' around, I'm underground, I fell down."

Flag of Utah

The Flag of the State of Utah was adopted in 1913 and has the Seal of Utah encircled in a golden circle on a background of dark navy blue.
In 1912, the Sons and Daughters of Utah Pioneers ordered a custom made copy of the newly adopted state flag to be showed off to the battleship USS Utah, which was commissioned on August 31, 1911. When the flag came, the group found out that the coat of arms on the flag was in full color instead of white, and the manufacturer had added a gold ring around the shield. Rather than have the flag remade, the Utah legislature changed the law to match the battleship flag, and the flag was showed off to the USS Utah.
A bald eagle, the national bird of the United States represents the safety of America. The arrows in the talons of the eagle represent courage in war. The sego lily, the Utah state flower, represents peace. The state motto "industry" represents progress, hard work, and community as does the emblem of the beehive, which is also a traditional Mormon symbol. Crossed Union flags show Utah's support and commitment to the United States. The name, Utah, appears underneath the beehive. The date 1847 represents the year Brigham Young led the first Mormons into the state. The year listed below that, 1896, represents the year that Utah was admitted to the Union. The gold circle around the state seal represents eternal order. The shield underneath the bald eagle represents common defense (military).
The design of the seal was adopted in 1850 by the Territory of Utah and changed by the artist "Harry Edwards" when Utah became a state in 1896.
According to most , the flag of the State of Deseret was almost the same to the flag of the State of Utah, but as it was not , many other secular and religious alternatives were also used.

Daniel Johnston, born 1961, is an American songwriter, singer, and artist who lives in Texas. Johnston has bipolar disorder. The movie "The Devil and Daniel Johnston" is about his life and music career.
Johnston grew up in West Virginia in a Christian family. He became a Beatles fan when he was young, then went off to college but did not finish. He moved to Texas to live with his brother, and ended up joining a circus. He left the circus after another worker beat him up for taking too long in a restroom, and found a church in Austin, Texas that helped him find somewhere to live. Johnston's religious beliefs are mentioned in many of his songs, especially on his CD "1990".
Johnston's music career started in Austin in the 1980s. He made cassette tapes of songs he performed on a chord organ and gave many of them out for free to people he met. He started playing concerts and became very popular with music fans in Texas. Johnston appeared on MTV, and became even more popular when Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain wore a T-shirt with the cover art of one of Johnston's CDs.
Johnston released one CD on Atlantic Records, a major record label (a big company that helps make CDs and sells them around the world) called "Fun" in 1994. However, he was not able to make any more CDs with Atlantic Records because not enough people bought "Fun". However, Johnston still writes songs, and his drawings appear on the covers of his CDs. His latest CD is "Is and Always Was", which came out in 2009.
In 2010, movie director David Miller announced that he was writing the script for a new movie about Johnston that would be very different from "The Devil and Daniel Johnston".

Velcro

Velcro is a brand name of fabric "hook-and-loop fasteners". It has of two layers: a "hook" side, which is a piece of fabric covered with tiny hooks, and a "loop" side, which is covered with even smaller and "hairier" loops. When the two sides are pressed together, the hooks catch in the loops and hold the pieces together. When they are separated, they make a special "ripping" sound.
The person who made Velcro was a scientist named George de Mestral. During a hunting vacation in Switzerland, de Mestral came home one evening and tried to remove the burrs stuck to his dog's fur. He was very surprised to see how hard the burrs were to remove. That night he studied the burrs under a microscope and noticed that each burr was covered with hundreds of small hooks acting like hands. De Mestral decided that this burr could be made to close fabric instead of buttons and zippers. By copying the hook pattern hat he saw on burrs, he made Velcro!
Velcro was named after the French words for velvet ("velour") and hook ("crochet"). The word "velcro" can also be used as a verb (for instance: "I "velcroed" my shoes").
