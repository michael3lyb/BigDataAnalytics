Down with Love

Down with Love is a 2003 American movie set in New York City in the 1960s. It stars Ewan McGregor and Renée Zellweger. It was inspired by "Pillow Talk" (1959) and "Lover Come Back" (1961).
Catcher Block (McGregor) is a very proud man. He has a lot of women and does not respect them very much. When author Barbara Novak (Zellweger) gets an interview with Block about her newest book, he keeps being busy and never actually interviews with her. Novak has written a feminist novel in which she says that women should take more power and have a bigger voice in things and to eat chocolate to reduce their need to be with men. However, when Novak's book becomes very popular, Block wants to know more about Novak.
Block invents a name for himself and begins to go out with her. She falls for him despite what she wrote in her book. She is about to take things further with Block when a woman rushes in to tell her that she loved Novak's book. It is then that Novak realizes that she has created a movement and that she needs to be the leader of that movement, so she no longer wants to see Block.
Block tries to reinvent himself as a new person. He writes an exposé on himself and wants to have it published, but all the women that used to work at his "No" magazine have all quit to try to get jobs at Novak's new "Now" magazine. Block applies for a job there and tells her that he loves her. After a short conversation, they leave in a helicopter to go to Las Vegas, Nevada to marry.

The Big Mac was created by Jim Delligatti, one of Ray Kroc's earliest franchisees, who was the owner of some restaurants in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area. It was designed to compete with a similar Big Boy sandwich. Customer response to the Big Mac was so good that it was begun to be made nationally in 1967. One of its well-known and unique features is a middle slice of bread ("club" layer) used to make sure the contents do not move about and to prevent spills.

Serenade

In music, a serenade (or sometimes serenata) is a song or piece of music which is sung or played in someone’s honour. The word comes from the Latin "serenare" meaning: "to make calm".
In the Middle Ages and Renaissance a serenade was usually a song which was sung by a lover underneath the window of his sweetheart in a country such as Spain. The lover may accompany himself on a guitar. This kind of serenade is often seen in operas, e.g. Mozart’s "Don Giovanni ". There is also a verb: to serenade, e.g. “the lover was serenading his sweetheart”.
In the Baroque period a serenade was a type of cantata performed outdoors, in the evening, with singers and various musical instrumentas. Composers who wrote this kind of serenade include Alessandro Stradella and Alessandro Scarlatti.
In the Classical music period the serenade became a piece of music for a small orchestra or a group of several instruments. They are similar to a symphony but lighter in character. They are often the same as a divertimento. Mozart wrote several serenades of this type, e.g. his famous "Eine kleine Nachtmusik". Later composers such as Brahms also wrote orchestral serenades. Other Romantic composers often wrote short instrumental works which they called “serenades”.
Also the word serenade is featured in the arctic monkey's song "reckless serenade".

Divertimento

A divertimento is a piece of music which is lighthearted and easy to listen to. It is often performed on social occasions, e.g. as music to be played while people eat, or as after-dinner music.
The divertimento became popular in the 18th century. They were played by a small group of instruments. Mozart wrote several pieces called "divertimento". They are similar to a serenade. A divertimento often has several movements, e.g. six, seven or more.
There are a few examples from the 20th century of pieces called "divertimento", e.g. works by including works by Ferruccio Busoni, Béla Bartók, and Igor Stravinsky (from his ballet "Le Baiser de la Fée").

Freemasonry

Freemasonry is an organization of people who believe in brotherhood and helping others. Its members are known as "Freemasons" (in full: "Ancient Free and Accepted Masons", or simply "Masons"). Freemasons also help one another in times of hardship. Freemasonry can be found all over the world in various forms. About 6 million people are Freemasons.
The local groups in various countries are known as "lodges". At the State or National level are "Grand Lodges". These are independent of each other. "Regular" Freemasonry is only for men, but there are also co-ed Masonic lodges (and lodges for only Women) that are not recognized as legitimate by the "regular" groups. All of these lodges believe in "brotherly love, relief and truth". They do work for charities such as running schools for orphaned children. There is a Royal Masonic Hospital which is a home for old members and their families.
The word mason means a man who works with stone. He is also called a "stonemason". Freemasonry grew from the groups (guilds) of stonemasons in the Middle Ages. These men were building cathedrals and other big buildings. They were called freemasons because they were free, they were not servants who belonged to a rich lord, like many workers were in those days. They often changed jobs and moved about from one town to another. In this way they were different from other craftsmen who often worked in one place and had guilds in one town. The stonemasons tried to keep their skills secret so that only they knew how to do their job. This is probably why the Freemasons have hand shakes and passwords that they swear to keep secret.
About 1650, Masons' guilds started to let people who were not masons into their guilds. In 1717, the first Grand Lodge (the Grand Lodge of England) was formed. It developed into the governing body of Freemasonry in England. In 1813, it merged with a rival and is now called the United Grand Lodge of England.
Freemasonry is controversial. It has been opposed on two grounds. The Catholic Church opposes Freemasonry, although Freemasonry itself does not block Catholics. The second is political. In Britain the Labour Party has advocated laws restricting Masonry.

Die Entführung aus dem Serail

The German libretto is by Christoph Friedrich Bretzner and was changed a bit, without Bretzner’s permission, by Gottlieb Stephanie. The story is about the hero Belmonte, helped by his servant Pedrillo, who tries to rescue his beloved Konstanze from the seraglio (palace) of the Pasha Selim.
The opera was first performed by the "Nationalsingspiel" ("national Singspiel") which was sponsored by the Austrian emperor Joseph II. Mozart arrived in Vienna in 1781 and was looking for an opportunity to get a commission for an opera. He showed one his operas ("Zaide") to the manager of the Nationalsingspiel. He was impressed and asked Mozart to write an opera for the company.
The work is lighthearted and meant to be funny. Some of the characters in the story are Turkish. Turkish stories and music were very popular at that time in Europe, and Mozart writes some Turkish music (or what Europeans thought was Turkish music) in this opera. Some of the arias are very difficult to sing, especially the long "Martern aller Arten" ("Tortures of all kinds") sung by Konstanze, which is like a concerto movement. She is accompanied in this aria by an orchestra and four solo instruments.
The opera was a huge success and earned Mozart a good sum of money. However, he was not paid properly for later performances, so it did not make him rich.
When Joseph II heard it he said to Mozart that there were “too many notes”, to which Mozart replied: “There are just as many notes as there should be”.
The singers perform with a Classical orchestra, to which are added instruments needed for "Turkish" music: bass drum, cymbals, triangle, and piccolo. The main orchestra has pairs of flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, horns, trumpets, a set of two timpani, and strings. In the aria, "Sorrow has become my lot", there is also a basset horn.
Konstanze, and her English servant Blondchen have been captured by pirates who sold them to the Turk, Pasha Selim. Belmonte goes to rescue her. Osmin, the Pasha's servant, comes to pluck figs in the garden and takes no notice of Belmonte who tries to get news about his servant, Pedrillo. Osmin is angry. After he leaves, Belmonte meets Pedrillo and they decide to rescue Konstanze. 
Selim appears with Konstanze. He wants her to love her, but she doesn’t. Pedrillo suggests to the Pasha that he should employ Belmonte as builder, but Osmin does not let him come into the palace.
Osmin tries roughly to make love to Blondchen. After a duet Osmin departs. Konstanze greets Blondchen in distress and tells her that Selim wants her love and is threatening to use force. 
When she has gone, Pedrillo comes to Blondchen, who is his sweetheart, and tells her that Belmonte is near and plans are ready for a rescue attempt. Blondchen is very happy. Pedrillo invites Osmin to drink. Osmin gets drunk and Belmonte gets him out of the way so that Belmonte again sees his beloved Konstanze.
Belmonte and Pedrillo come to the garden with ladders. Belmonte manages to snatch Konstanze away, but when Pedrillo is about to escape with Blondchen, they are caught by Osmin, and Belmonte and Konstanze are also brought back by the guard. Belmonte asks the Pasha not to kill them. He says that his father is a rich Spanish governor who will pay a lot of money so that they are freed. Selim Pasha says to Belmonte that he is the son of his greatest enemy, so he is delighted to have caught him. However, the Pasha then becomes kind and decides to forgive them and set them free. Osmin is not happy about this. He would have loved to see them executed.

The Hours (movie)

The Hours is a 2002 Anglo-American drama movie. It is based on Michael Cunningham's novel "The Hours". Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore, and Meryl Streep play the main characters. It was picked for nine Academy Awards and won one, Best Actress for Kidman.
The movie is about three women living in different times. The first is bipolar novelist Virginia Woolf (Kidman) trying to write the novel "Mrs Dalloway" in Richmond, Surrey in 1923. The second is Laura Brown, a housewife in California in 1951 who is reading the novel. The third is Clarissa Vaughan, who lives in New York City in 2001 and tends to a gay poet named Richard. He often calls her "Mrs. D" or "Mrs. Dalloway" in reference to the novel. The movie moves from one character to another many times and each character is shown for a similar amount of time.
Woolf struggles to write her novel. Her hand shakes and she cannot write well. The movie begins with her suicide where she fills her pockets full of rocks and drowns herself in the river Ouse in Sussex. In flashback, it shows her difficulty writing. Her sister Vanessa Bell comes over. Woolf is very fascinated when her niece Angelica finds a dead bird. Woolf kisses her sister very hard when she leaves. Finally, she tries to go to the train station and tells her husband Leonard that she would rather go back to the city than live in the countryside.
Laura is depressed and does not like her life. She makes a cake with her son for her husband and does it again when the first one does not come out right. Her friend Kitty is going to a doctor; something is wrong with her. Finally, she takes her son Richie and leaves him at a babysitter and rents a hotel room. She starts reading the book and then we see what it is through her mind – she suddenly imagines that there is a lot of water coming up, like she is drowning.
Vaughn is hosting a party for Richard to celebrate something. She spends a lot of time preparing food and decorations for the party. In the end, however, Richard kills himself by jumping out of the window.

Linux distribution

Linux distributions are made of the Linux kernel and a collection of applications. The operating system will be made up of the Linux kernel and, usually, a set of libraries and utilities from the GNU project, with graphics that come from the X Window System. Distributions that are made to be small may not contain big window systems full of features like KDE or GNOME, but use small window systems like busybox, uclibc or dietlibc. There are more than three hundred Linux distributions. Most of those are in still in development, being improved and changed constantly.
Before the first Linux distributions, a Linux user needed to be a Unix expert, knowing what libraries and executables that were needed to get the system to boot and run.
Linux distributions started to form after the Linux kernel was starting to be used by people outside the original Linux programmers. They were more interested in creating the operating system than making it user-friendly.
Early distributions included: 
SLS was not well-maintained, so Patrick Volkerding created a distribution based on SLS, which he called "Slackware"; released July 16, 1993. This is the oldest being developed.
People who used computers wanted to use Linux distributions as replacements to Microsoft Windows operating systems on the PC, Mac OS on the Apple Macintosh and proprietary versions of Unix.
Distributions are normally split into packages. Each package has a certain application or service. Examples of packages include a collection of fonts, or a web browser.
The package is usually given as compiled code, with installation and removal of packages done by a package management system]. 
Linux distributions usually contain much more software than Microsoft Windows or Mac OS X.
Well-known Linux distributions include:

Kurram or Karam () tribal agency is in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) area of Pakistan. Until the year 2000, when divisions were abolished, Kurram District used to be part of the Peshawar Division of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.
The Kurram River drains the southern flanks of the Safed Koh mountain range, and enters the Indus plains north of Bannu. It crosses the Afghan-Pakistan border about 80 km southwest of Jalalabad, and joins the Indus near Isa Khel after a course of more than 320 km (200 miles). The district has an area of 3,310 km² (1,278 sq. miles); the population according to the 1998 census was 448,310. It lies between the Miranzai Valley and the Afghan border, and is inhabited by the Bangash,Mangal and Turis, a tribe of Turki and Pathan origin. The language of the tribes is Pashto, but unlike majority of the Pashtuns they are Shias.
It is highly irrigated, well peopled, and crowded with small fortified villages, orchards and groves, to which a fine background is afforded by the dark pine forests and alpine snows of the Safed Koh. The beauty and climate of the valley attracted some of the Mogul emperors of Delhi, and the remains exist of a garden planted by Shah Jahan.
The Kurram River crosses the Afghan-Pakistan border about 80 km southwest of Jalalabad and in ancient times offered the most direct route to Kabul and Gardez, but the route crossed the Peiwar Pass 3,439 m (11,283 ft) high, just over 20 km west of Parachinar, which was blocked by snow for several months of the year.

Pantomimes are usually meant for children-however it could be directed at adults
A "pantomimos" in Ancient Greece used to be an entertainment performed by a solo dancer. In the Middle Ages a form of theatre developed called Commedia dell'arte. This was similar to a pantomime. They told a story which had certain fixed characters: the lovers, the father, the servants etc.
The Pantomime first arrived in England as a short entertainment (entr'acte) between opera pieces. Eventually it became a separate show.
Today the pantomime is traditionally performed at Christmas. It is a show for children, but grownups like it as well. Usually a well-known story is told, e.g. Cinderella, Jack and the Beanstalk, Pinocchio, The Three Little Pigs, Puss in Boots, The Musicians of Bremen, Little Red Riding Hood and Goldilocks and the Three Bears and Snow White etc. There is a lot of spoken dialogue but there are also songs, and sometimes the audience join in. There are many traditions in pantomime. These are some of the main ones:

<doc id="118736" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=118736" title="Michael Collins (Irish leader)">
Michael Collins (Irish leader)

Michael "Mick" Collins ( 16 October 1890 – 22 August 1922) was an Irish revolutionary leader. He was a Minister for Finance and Teachta Dála (TD "member of parliament") for Cork South in the First Dáil of 1919. He was also the Director of Intelligence for the IRA, and member of the Irish delegation during the Anglo-Irish Treaty negotiations. After that he was both Chairman of the Provisional Government and Commander-in-chief of the National Army. Throughout this time, at least as of 1919, he was also President of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Under the rules of the Brotherhood this meant that he was President of the Irish Republic. Collins was shot and killed in August 1922, during the Irish Civil War.
He was born on his family farm named Woodfield in Sam's Cross near Clonikilty, West Cork. Michael Collins was the third son and youngest of eight children. Most biographies state his date of birth as 16 October 1890; however, his tombstone gives his date of birth as 12 October 1890. His father, also named Michael, was a member of the republican Fenian movement, but had left and settled down to farming. Collins was six years old when his father died.
After leaving school aged 15, Collins took the British Civil Service examination in Cork in February 1906. In 1910, he moved to London where he became a messenger at a London firm of stock brokers, Horne and Company. While in London he lived with his elder sister, and studied at King's College London. He joined the London GAA and, through this, the Irish Republican Brotherhood, a secret, oath-bound society dedicated to achieving Irish independence. In 1915, he moved to the Guaranty Trust Company of New York where he remained until his return to Ireland the following year.
Michael Collins first became known during the Easter Rising in 1916. A skilled organiser and very intelligent, he was highly respected in the IRB. When the Rising itself took place on Easter Monday, 1916, he fought alongside Patrick Pearse and others in the General Post Office in Dublin.
Collins, like many of the other participants, was arrested, almost executed. He was imprisoned at Frongoch internment camp. Collins became one of the leading figures in Sinn Féin after the Rising. This was a small nationalist party which the British government and the Irish media wrongly blamed for the Rising. By October 1917, Collins had become a member of the executive of Sinn Féin and director of organisation of the Irish Volunteers. Éamon de Valera was president of both organisations.
Collins was nominated in the 1918 general election to elect Irish MPs to the British House of Commons in London. Collins won for Sinn Féin, becoming MP for Cork South. However, unlike their rivals in the Irish Parliamentary Party, Sinn Féin MPs had announced that they would not take their seats in Westminster, but instead would set up an Irish Parliament in Dublin.
That new parliament, called "Dáil Éireann" (meaning "Assembly of Ireland") met in the Mansion House, Dublin in January 1919, although De Valera and leading Sinn Féin MPs had been arrested.
In de Valera's absence, Cathal Brugha was elected Príomh Aire ('Main' or 'Prime', Minister', but often translated as 'President of Dáil Éireann'). He was replaced by de Valera, when Collins helped him escape from Lincoln Prison in April 1919.
The Irish War of Independence began on the same day that the First Dáil met on 21 January 1919. An ambush party of IRA volunteers acting without orders and led by Seán Treacy attacked a group of Royal Irish Constabulary men. They were escorting a shipment of gelignite to a quarry in Soloheadbeg, County Tipperary. Two policemen were shot dead during the fight. This incident is considered to be the first action taken in the Irish War of Independence.
In 1919, Collins had a number of roles. In the summer he was elected president of the IRB, Director of Intelligence of the Irish Republican Army. He also became the Minister for Finance. His ministry was able to organise a large bond issue in the form of a "National Loan" to fund the new Irish Republic. Collins and Richard Mulcahy were the two main organisers for the Irish Republican Army, in as far as it was possible to direct the actions of disorganised guerrilla units.
In 1920, the British offered a prize of £10,000 (equivalent to GB£300,000 / €360,000 in 2010) for information leading to the capture or death of Collins. His fame had so transcended the IRA movement that he was nicknamed "The Big Fellow".
In July 1921, the British suddenly offered a truce. Arrangements were made for a conference between the British government and the leaders of the as-yet unrecognised Irish Republic.
In August 1921, Eamonn de Valera made the Dáil upgrade his office from Prime Minister to President of the Irish Republic. This made him on the same level as George V in the negotiations. Eventually, however, he said that as the King would not attend, then neither would he. Instead, with the reluctant agreement of his cabinet, de Valera assembled a team of delegates to go in his place. The team was headed by Vice-President Arthur Griffith with Collins as Deputy.
The negotiations resulted in the Anglo-Irish Treaty which was signed on 6 December 1921. In it, a new state was agreed upon, called the "Irish Free State". The agreement made an all-Ireland state possible. The six-county region in the northeast could opt out of the Free State if they wanted to. If this happened, an Irish Boundary Commission was to redraw the Irish border. The Irish Free State was established in December 1922, and as expected, Northern Ireland opted to remain part of the United Kingdom proper.
Although it was not the republic he was fighting for, Collins concluded that the Treaty offered Ireland "the freedom to achieve freedom." He knew that the treaty, and in particular the issue of partition, would not be popular in Ireland. When he signed the treaty, he said "I have signed my own death warrant."
Sinn Féin split over the treaty, and the Dáil debated the matter bitterly for ten days until it was approved by a vote of 64 to 57. The Supreme Council of the IRB, which was informed in detail about the Treaty negotiations voted unanimously ("without exceptions") to accept the Treaty. The only exception was the later COS of the IRA Liam Lynch.
As expected, the Treaty was extremely controversial in Ireland.
First, Éamon de Valera, President of the Irish Republic until 9 January, had been unhappy that Collins had signed any deal without his and his cabinet's authorisation.
Second, the contents of the Treaty were bitterly disputed. De Valera and many other members of the republican movement did not want Ireland to be a dominion of the British Empire. They did not like the "symbolism" of having to give a statement of faithfulness to the British king.
The dividing of Ireland between the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland was not as controversial. One of the main reasons for this was that Collins was secretly planning to launch a guerrilla war against the Northern State. In the early months of 1922, he had sent IRA units to the border, and arms and money to the northern units. In May–June 1922, he and IRA Chief of Staff Liam Lynch organised an attack of both pro- and anti-treaty IRA units along the new border. This offensive was officially called off under British pressure on 3 June and Collins issued a statement that "no troops from the 26 counties, either those under official control [pro-treaty] or those attached to the [IRA] Executive [anti-treaty] should be permitted to invade the six county area."
The new Provisional Government () was formed under Collins, who became "President of the Provisional Government of Southern Ireland" (i.e., Prime Minister). He also remained Minister for Finance of Griffith's republican administration after de Valera stepped down.
In the months leading up to the outbreak of civil war in June 1922, Collins tried to heal the split in the nationalist movement and prevent civil war. De Valera, having opposed the Treaty in the Dáil, withdrew from the assembly with his supporters. Collins secured a compromise, "The Collins/De Valera Pact", whereby the two factions of Sinn Féin, pro- and anti-Treaty, would fight the soon-to-be Free State's first election jointly and form a coalition government afterwards. This Pact was agreed without Griffith's knowledge and he opposed it as a potential betrayal of the Treaty. For a time it appeared that a split would occur in the pro-Treaty ranks but Griffith relented realizing that Collins held all the power. His friendship with Collins did not survive. [ANTHONY J. JORDAN IN "ARTHUR GRIFFITH with James Joyce & WB Yeats - Liberating Ireland". Westport Books. isbn 9780957622906 pp. 173–5 & 188-189.]
To try and find a compromise, Collins proposed that the Free State would have a republican constitution, with no mention of the British king. However, the British did not sign the proposed republican constitution. They argued they had signed the Treaty in good faith and its terms could not be changed so quickly.
On 14 April 1922, a group of 200 anti-Treaty IRA men occupied the Four Courts in Dublin in defiance of the Provisional government. Collins, who wanted to avoid civil war at all costs, did not attack them until June 1922, when British pressure also forced his hand. After a final attempt to persuade the men to leave, Collins borrowed two 18 pounder artillery pieces from the British and bombarded the Four Courts until the men surrendered.
This led to the Irish Civil War as fighting broke out in Dublin between the anti-Treaty IRA and the provisional government's troops.
Under Collins' supervision, the Free State rapidly took control of the capital. In July 1922, anti-Treaty forces held the southern province of Munster and several other areas of the country. De Valera and the other anti-Treaty TDs supported the anti-Treaty IRA.
By mid-1922, Collins no longer really worked as Chairman of the Provisional Government. He became the Commander-in-Chief of the National Army, a formal uniformed army that formed around the pro-Treaty IRA.
Collins, along with Richard Mulcahy and Eoin O'Duffy decided on a series of seaborne landings into republican held areas. They re-took Munster and the west in July–August 1922. As part of this offensive, Collins travelled to his native Cork. This was against the advice of his companions, and despite suffering from stomach ache and depression. Collins is said to have told his comrades that "They wouldn't shoot me in my own county". 
He recorded his plan for peace in his diary: Republicans must "accept the People's Verdict" on the Treaty, but could then "go home without their arms ("guns"). We don't ask for any surrender of their principles". "We want to avoid any possible unnecessary destruction and loss of life." But if Republicans did not accept his terms, "further blood is on their shoulders".
On the road to Bandon, at the village of "Béal na mBláth" (Irish, "the Mouth of Flowers"), Collins stopped to ask directions. However the man whom they asked, Dinny Long, was also a member of the local Anti-Treaty IRA. An ambush was then prepared for the convoy when it made its journey back to Cork city. They knew Collins would return by the same road as the two other roads from Bandon to Cork were destroyed by Republicans. The ambush party, commanded by Liam Deasy, opened fire on Collins' convoy.
Collins was killed in the gun battle, which lasted about 20 minutes, from 8:00 p.m. to 8:20 p.m. He was the only fatality. He had ordered his convoy to stop and return fire, instead of choosing the safer option of driving on in his touring car or transferring to the safety of the accompanying armoured car, as his companion, Emmet Dalton, had wished. They do not know who fired the fatal shot.
Collins' men brought his body back to Cork where it was then shipped to Dublin because it was feared the body might be stolen in an ambush if it were transported by road. His body lay in state for three days in Dublin City Hall where tens of thousands of mourners walked past his coffin to pay their respects. His funeral mass took place at Dublin's Pro Cathedral where a number of foreign and Irish dignitaries were in attendance. Some 500,000 people attended his funeral, almost one fifth of the country's population.
Eamon de Valera is reported to have stated in 1966:
"I can't see my way to becoming Patron of the Michael Collins Foundation. It is my considered opinion that in the fullness of time history will record the greatness of Collins and it will be recorded at my expense"
However, there is some doubt that de Valera ever made this controversial statement.
An annual commemoration ceremony takes place each year in August at the ambush site at Béal na mBláth, Cork.
There is also a remembrance ceremony in Glasnevin at Collins' graveside.
The Collins 22 Society established in 2002 is an international organisation dedicated to keeping the name and legacy of Michael Collins in living memory. The patron of the society is Nora Owen, grand-niece of Michael Collins.
The 1936 movie "Beloved Enemy", starring David Niven, is a fictionalised account of Collins' life. Unlike the real Michael Collins, the fictionalised "Dennis Riordan" (played by Brian Aherne) is shot, but recovers. "Hang Up Your Brightest Colours", a British documentary by Kenneth Griffith, was made for ITV in 1973, but refused transmission. It was eventually screened by the BBC in Wales in 1993 and across the United Kingdom the following year.
An Irish documentary made by Colm Connolly for RTE Television in 1989 called "The Shadow of Béal na Bláth" covered Collins' death. A made for TV film, "The Treaty", was produced in 1991 and starred Brendan Gleeson as Collins and Ian Bannen as David Lloyd George. In 2007 RTE produced a documentary entitled "Get Collins", centered around the intelligence war which took place in Dublin.
Collins was the subject of director Neil Jordan's 1996 film "Michael Collins", with Liam Neeson in the title role.

School

A school is a place where people go to learn about topics such as reading, writing and mathematics.There is usually 5 main subjects including reading, English, math, science, history (social studies) .In a school, one or more teachers help pupils or students to learn. Today, most countries require by law that children go to school for a number of years. They learn some of what they need later in life, such as reading, writing, and some basic mathematics. Learning can take place in the classroom, in the outside environments or on visits to other locations. Colleges and universities are also places to learn, for students over 17 or 18. Vocational schools teach skills people need for jobs.
Some people attend school longer than others. This is because some jobs require more training than others. For young children, one teacher is able to teach all subjects, but teachers for older students are specialized and they only teach a few subjects. Common subjects taught include science, arts such as music and humanities, like geography and history, and languages.
Children with mental issues that are too much for the school to handle are not required to attend regular schools. These children must be given other ways to receive required schooling. There also are special schools which teach things which regular schools do not.
Graduate schools are for students who have graduated from college.
Education for all is quite modern. In England, for example, most people could not read or write, even in the 18th century. We know this because when they got married, those who could not write put an 'X' on the certificate, and someone else wrote their name. Mass education for reading and writing began in the 19th century.
Originally, in most countries, boys were taught differently and separately from girls. 
Some schools are for boys and some schools are for girls; they only accept boys, or girls, but not both. Long ago, most schools were run by religious denominations. That is because clerics were once almost the only people who were literate. Since there are only men in a monastery, this was often also true for the school, which only accepted boys. Going to a school also meant learning about religion. Some places still do not have schools for girls.
In many parts of the world, schools also help children learn things about life.
Pedagogy is the science of teaching (children). There are different approaches to teaching. Similarly, certain schools use different approaches. There is quite a lot of disagreement about what and how students should be taught. Many countries solve this by allowing different types of school, so parents and children have some choice.

<doc id="118975" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=118975" title="Karyotype">
Karyotype

A karyotype is the number and appearance of chromosomes in the nucleus of a eukaryote cell. The term is also used of the complete set of chromosomes in a species, or an individual organism. It describes the number of chromosomes, and what they look like under a light microscope. Attention is paid to their length, the position of the centromeres, any differences between the sex chromosomes, and any other physical characteristics. The preparation and study of karyotypes is part of cytogenetics (cytology and genetics).
The basic number of chromosomes in the somatic (body) cells of an individual or a species is called the "somatic number" and is designated "2n". Thus, in humans 2n = 46. In the sex cells the chromosome number is "n" (humans: n = 23).
So, in normal diploid organisms, chromosomes are present in two copies. There may, or may not, be sex chromosomes. Polyploid cells have multiple copies of chromosomes and haploid cells have single copies. The study of whole sets of chromosomes is sometimes known as "karyology". 
The chromosomes are depicted (by rearranging a microphotograph) in a standard format known as a "karyogram" or "idiogram": in pairs, ordered by size and position of centromere for chromosomes of the same size. This may be used for many purposes; such as, to show genetic disease, what sex the animal is and its diploid number. In humans, cytologists have used karyotypes to help identify genetic abnormalities a baby might have before it is born.
Karyotypes may be studied to gather information about past evolutionary events, such as polyploidy.

Liège (, , ) is a city in Belgium. It is the cultural centre of the Walloon region of Belgium and the capital of the province of Liège. Liège is also seat of a Roman Catholic bishop. In 2007, 188,907 people lived there.
It is at 50° 38 North, 05° 34 East.
The first written trace of the city was found in 558 as "Leodicum" or "Vicus Leodicus". From 717, Liege was made the seat of a bishopric and became a cultural centre in the Middle Ages. These bishops ruled the city as Prince-Bishops until the 1790s. In the French Revolution, the cathedral was damaged, partially burned down and then completely detroyed. In the 19th century, the city lived on coal-mining, steel industry and trade. The region was the second biggest economic center in Europe after the UK in the 19th century.
Today Liege is a major educational hub, with a university and many high schools. It is a crossing point in Europe, Liège has the second biggest inner harbour and the 8th biggest cargo airport in Europe (Liège Airport). The city, that had a lot of problems since the 1970s because of the end of the steel industry and coal-mining, is now having a good economy thanks to the logistics and high tech industry (biotechnology, space industry, IT).

Idomeneo

Idomeneo is an opera seria with music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The libretto (words) are in Italian and were written by Giambattista Varesco. He based it on a French text by Antoine Danchet. In 1780 Mozart and Varesco were asked by the Elector of Bavaria to write an opera for a court carnival. 
"Idomeneo" was first performed in Munich on 29 January 1781. Mozart was only 24 years old. It was the first of his great operas.
Mozart wrote three different types of opera: " Idomeneo" is an opera seria (serious opera). These were written in Italian, and are about serious, dramatic stories, often stories from Ancient Greece or Rome. "La Clemenza di Tito" is also an opera seria. "Don Giovanni" is an example of a mixture of comic and serious opera, while "The Magic Flute" is a German opera in the Singspiel tradition.
"Idomeneo" has traditional recitatives and arias. The choruses, marches, and ballets were very much like French opera tradition. Mozart was inspired by the operas of Gluck.
The story, based on an Ancient Greek story, takes place on the Island of Crete, shortly after the Trojan War. Ilia is the daughter of the Trojan King Priam who has lost the war. Ilia has been taken to Crete. She loves Prince Idamante, son of Idomeneo, but does not want to tell him about her love for him. Idamante is kind and frees the Trojan prisoners. He tells Ilia that it is not his fault that their fathers were enemies. The Trojans and Cretans (people from Crete) both welcome the return of peace, but Electra, daughter of the Greek King Agamemnon is jealous of Ilia. She is annoyed that Idamante had been kind and let the prisoners free. Arbace, the king's trusted friend, brings news that Idomeneo has been drowned at sea while returning to Crete from Troy. Electra, worried that Ilia, a Trojan, soon will be Queen of Crete, feels the furies of Hades tormenting her.
Idomeneo is not lost at sea, but instead is saved by Neptune (god of the sea) and is washed up on a Cretan beach. There he remembers the promise he made to Neptune: he had promised to sacrifice (kill for the Gods) the first creature he should meet, whether it be a human or an animal. The first person he meets is his own son, Idamante. Because the two have not seen each other for a long time, they do not recognize one another at first. When Idomeneo finally realizes it is his own son he must kill, he tells Idamante to go away and never see him again. Idamante does not understand why his father is saying this. He is terribly upset, but runs off. The Cretan soldiers get off Idomeneo's ship and are met by their wives, and all praise Neptune.
At the king's palace, Idomeneo asks Arbace what he should do, because he has disobeyed the god. Arbace says that Neptune would be happy if another victim could be sacrificed so long as Idamante is sent into exile (to another country). Idomeneo tells his son to take Electra to her home, Argos. Idomeneo's kind words to Ilia make her say very kindly that, because she has lost everything, he will be her father and Crete will be her country. As she leaves, Idomeneo realizes that sending Idamante into exile has made Ilia unhappy. Electra is happy about going to Argos with Idamante.
At the port of Sidon, Idomeneo says goodbye to his son and tells him to rule like a good king. Before the ship can sail, however, a storm breaks out, and a sea serpent appears. It is a messenger from Neptune, who is angry with Idomeneo. Idomeneo offers his life to the god.
In the royal garden, Ilia asks the gentle winds to carry her love to Idamante. Idamante says he must go to fight the serpent. When he says he would like to die because Ilia does not love him. This makes Ilia tell him that she loves him. They are surprised by Electra and Idomeneo. When Idamante asks his father why he sends him away, Idomeneo cannot tell him the truth. Ilia asks Electra for some kindness, but Elektra is madly jealous of Ilia now, and she wants revenge. Arbace comes with news that the people, led by the High Priest of Neptune, are shouting that they want Idomeneo. The High Priest tells the king that Neptune's monster is destroying things, and asks Idomeneo to say the name of the person whose sacrifice is demanded by the god. When the king says that his own son is the victim, the people are horrified. 
Outside the temple, the king and High Priest join with Neptune's priests to pray that the god will be kind and merciful. Arbace brings news that Idamante has killed the monster. Idomeneo is now worried that Neptune will want even more revenge. Idamante enters in sacrificial robes, saying he understands his father's terrible worries and he is ready to die., Idomeneo says a tragic goodbye to his own son and is about to kill him, when Ilia steps forward and offers to die instead. Neptune now changes his mind. We hear his voice saying that if Idomeneo gives up being king and lets Idamante and Ilia rule as king and queen, he will forgive. Everyone is happy except Electra, who wants to die. Idomeneo says that Idamante and his bride as the new rulers. The people call upon the god of love and marriage to bless the royal pair and bring peace.

Carbohydrate

Carbohydrates are chemical compounds that contain "only" oxygen, hydrogen and carbon. They are made up of joined-up sugars. Sugars have the general formula C(HO), and are also known as saccharides.
Certain carbohydrates are an important storage and transport form of energy in most organisms, including plants and animals.
There are four types of carbohydrates, named by the number of sugar molecules they contain. 
Carbohydrates are the most common source of energy for the human body. Protein builds tissue and cells in the body. Carbohydrates are very good for energy, but, if a person eats more than needed, the extra is changed into fat.
If necessary, humans can live without eating carbohydrates because the human body can change proteins into carbohydrates. People of some cultures eat food with very little carbohydrates, but they still remain healthy. 
Research in the United States and Canada have shown that people get about 40% to 60% of their energy from carbohydrates. However, studies suggest that some people get at least 55% to 75% of energy from carbohydrates. It may depend on the amount of physical work done by people: the harder the work, the more energy they need. The other need for energy is body temperature. Living in a cold climate means a person needs more energy.
Some foods have high levels of carbohydrates including bread, pasta, potatoes, and cereals.

Retie is a municipality in the Belgian province of Antwerp.
In 2007, 10485 people lived there.
It is at 51° 16 North, 05° 05 East.
The town is near the Dutch border and is in fact closer to the city of Eindhoven than Antwerp.
The official language of the area is Dutch, but many people especially in the hospitality industry speak English and French.
Services
Services are basic in Retie, some banks have branches including ING and AXA. Supermarket shopping is available. Bakeries in Retie are very good. Like most of Belgium the shops are generally closed on Sunday.
The Gemeente (local council) official website (in Dutch) is http://www.retie.be/ 
Things to do in and around Retie
There is a pretty town hall in the centre of the town, but unlike many Belgian towns it is not organised around a town square (well it is now just a large intersection) and therefore does not have the quaint village feel as many other small towns in this part of Belgium (for example Lommel, Mol).
The main attraction of the town is Prinsenpark - a public forest that is popular with families and walking/jogging groups. Dogs on leads are allowed. There are picnic tables and toilets.

A Mast-Allah is a kind of spiritual person in the part of the Muslim religion called Sufism. Masts sometimes seem strange or crazy to people who don't know about them, but Sufis of Iran, Pakistan, and India believe they are not really crazy, but are saints. 
The Indian teacher Meher Baba asked a doctor named William Donkin to write a book about masts called "The Wayfarers." Wayfarer means wanderer, and the book's title implied that masts are on a spiritual journey. Meher Baba wrote the introduction of the book. In his introduction Meher Baba explained that masts are traveling along an internal path and are lost because they are so dazzled (amazed) by the sights they see. They are so amazed and dazzled by these sights they see that they forget how to act normally. So Meher Baba says they are like people who are drunk, only the masts are not drunk on alcohol but on God and are very close to God.

It was built as a public bath in the years 1845-1848 by Eduard van der Nüll and August Sicard von Sicardsburg. It was used as a bath in winter. During the summer, the swimming pool was covered with wooden planks. The venue could then be used for concerts, and as a dance venue. In March 1912 Karl May gave his last public speech there. He had an audience of about 2000 people. In September 1913, the first movies that had sound were shown in the building. This was later stopped however, as there were problems with making sure the sound was at the right time in the movie (called synchronicity). 
In May 1938, Richard Suchenwirth founded the NSDAP Austria section there. During the war, the venue was used to collect the Jews (who were later deported). The building was restored to its former glory by Carl Appel in 1948. In the 1950, DECCA installed the most modern recording studio in Europe in the rooms. The studio was used until the 1970s, to make recordings of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, amongst others.

Ordinary language philosophy

Ordinary language philosophy is a way of doing philosophy that uses ordinary, everyday words. It came out of analytic philosophy, the most common way of doing philosophy in English-speaking countries in the 20th century.
Analytic philosophers like Bertrand Russell thought that ordinary language was confused, and tried to use the ideal or most accurate words to describe ideas. Ordinary language philosophers thought that analytic philosophers had a problem with forgetting what words really mean. They thought that using ordinary words would make their ideas clearer and their mistakes easier to spot.
Ordinary language philosophy came out of followers of the later work of Ludwig Wittgenstein at the University of Oxford, and was most popular between 1930 and 1970.

La Clemenza di Tito

La Clemenza di Tito is a libretto written by Pietro Metastasio in 1734. It has been used by nearly 40 different composers. The most famous version is by Mozart.
Vitellia, is the daughter of Vitellius who has lost his position of emperor. Vitellius wants revenge against Titus. Vitellia asks Titus's friend Sextus, who is in love with her, to act against him. But when she hears that Titus has sent Berenice of Cilicia, of whom she was jealous, back to Jerusalem, Vitellia tells Sextus to wait a while before doing what she had asked, hoping Titus will choose her (Vitellia) as his empress.
Titus, however, decides to choose Sextus's sister Servilia to be his empress, and tells Annius (Sextus's friend) to take the message to Servilia. Annius and Servilia are in love, although Titus does not know this, so neither of them like this news. Servilia decides to tell Titus the truth but also says that if Titus still insists on marrying her, she will obey. Titus thanks the gods for Servilia's truthfulness and immediately promises to give up the idea of coming between her and Annius.
In the meantime, however, Vitellia has heard the news about Titus's interest in Servilia and is again very jealous. She urges Sextus to kill Titus. He agrees, singing one of the opera's most famous arias, "Parto, parto." Almost as soon as he leaves, Annius and the guard Publius arrive to take Vitellia to Titus, who has now chosen her as his empress. She is torn with feelings of guilt and worry over what she has sent Sextus to do. 
Sextus, meanwhile, is at the Capitol, which he and his friends are going to burn down. Sextus cannot think what is the right thing to do. The other characters (except Titus) enter and are horrified to see the burning Capitol. Sextus comes in again and says that he saw Titus being killed, but Vitellia stops him giving away the fact that he was the killer. The others lament Titus in a slow, sad end to Act I.
Begins with Annius telling Sextus that Emperor Titus is in fact alive and has just been seen. In the smoke and chaos, Sextus thought he has seen Titus, but it was someone else. Soon Publius arrives to arrest Sextus, bringing the news that it was one of Sextus’ friends who dressed himself in Titus's robes and was stabbed by Sextus, but he did not die. The Senate take a court case against Sextus as Titus waits impatiently, sure that his friend will be found not guilty; but the Senate finds him guilty, and a terribly sad Titus must sign Sextus' death papers. 
He decides to send for Sextus first, trying to get further details about the plot. Sextus takes all the guilt on himself and says he deserves death, so Titus tells him he shall have death, and sends him away. But after a lot of painful thinking, Titus tears up the execution papers for Sextus and decides that, if the world wants to accuse him (Titus) of anything, then people can say that he allowed too much mercy, insteady of saying that he always wanted revenge. 
Vitellia feels terrible about what has happened and decides to tell all the truth to Titus, giving up her hopes of empire. In the amphitheater, the condemned (including Sextus) are waiting to be thrown to the wild animals. Titus is about to show mercy when Vitellia explains that she started Sextus's plot. Though shocked, the emperor includes her in the general clemency (forgiveness) he offers. The opera finishes with all the people praising the kindness of Titus, while he himself asks the gods to end his life if he ever stops caring for the good of Rome. 
In July 1791 Mozart was asked to write an "opera seria". He had been asked by Domenico Guardasoni who lived in Prague and who had the job of finding someone to compose an opera for the celebrations of the coronation of Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor as King of Bohemia. The ceremony would take place on September 6, so Mozart had to work quickly.
Guardasoni had asked Antonio Salieri to write the opera, but Salieri was too busy, so he then asked Mozart. Mozart was glad to accept, because he was paid twice as much as when he wrote an opera for Vienna.

<doc id="119483" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=119483" title="The Omen">
The Omen

The Omen is a 1976 American suspense/horror movie set in England. It was directed by Richard Donner. The movie stars Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, David Warner, Harvey Stephens, Billie Whitelaw, Patrick Troughton, Martin Benson, and Leo McKern. A remake, "The Omen," was released on June 6, 2006.
This movie has a sequel, "".
Dick Van Dyke was once offered the role as Ambassador Thorn, but turned it down because of the movie's violent gory content.
A series of events happened during the making of "The Omen" (October 1975 to January 1976) that caused some speculation as to whether or not the film was "cursed".
Separate flights for both actor Gregory Peck and executive producer Mace Neufeld were struck by lightning when flying between the USA and England, and producer Harvey Bernhard was barely missed by a lightning bolt in Rome. A restaurant that Neufeld and Peck were to eat at in England was bombed by the IRA.
A plane hired by the studio to take aerial shots in Israel was switched at the last moment by the airline, and the clients who took the original plane were all killed when it crashed on takeoff. Some time later, a zookeeper who was helping the studio with handling animals was attacked and eaten alive by lions. After working on "The Omen", stuntman Alf Joint went on to work on "A Bridge Too Far" where he was pushed off a building during a stunt gone wrong.
On Friday, August 13, 1976, special effects artist John Richardson was in an accident in the Netherlands while working on "A Bridge Too Far", also right after work on "The Omen" was done. Less than a year after designing the deaths for "The Omen", Richardson's car was involved in a major accident which killed and decapitated his female companion, in a way similar to David Warner's death in "The Omen". It is rumored that upon stumbling out of his car he saw a road sign that said he was near the town of Ommen, marked 66.6 km away.
There are no road signs in the Netherlands giving distances in fractions of kilometres. Only kilometre markers use fractions. Near Raalte is a junction where the N348 joins the N35. This location currently corresponds with kilometre marker 66.6 on route N348. A road sign stating the direction towards Ommen is less than fifty metres away from this kilometre marker.
A local newspaper named De Stentor did some research into this matter and contacted a former police officer from the area. According to the police officer, the accident indeed took place near Raalte on the N348 between Raalte and Deventer, but not on the location where the 66.6 kilometre marker currently is.
Based on the current location of the marker and the details given by the police officer, another possible scenario is that Richardson was brought to a hospital in Zwolle and crossed the junction of the N348 with the N35. There he may have noticed kilometre marker 66.6, and immediately after that a road sign stating the direction towards Ommen. This may have freaked him out to the point that it became part of the legend of the curse.

Chevrolet Corvette

The Chevrolet Corvette is a sports car that has been built by Chevrolet since 1953. It is now in its 7th generation.
The Corvette C1 was the first Corvette model. It was created by GM (General Motors) in 1953. It was designed by Harley Earl and it was a show car. Chevrolet only made 300 Corvettes in 1953, and they are all almost the same. The C1 was the only model of Corvette to have an inline-6 engine option, and the inline-6 was only available from 1953 to 1955. Because the C1 was expensive and kind of slow, it was in danger of not being made anymore. Chevrolet changed the C1 in 1956, which made it faster and better. Afterwards, the car became more popular, and the C1 was built until 1962. 
The Corvette C2 was the second Corvette model. The C2 was first built in 1963 and was made until 1967. The C2 was the first Corvette that could be bought as a coupé. The C2 was also the first Corvette to only offer V8 engines. The C2 became known as the Corvette Sting Ray. The C2 was much better and more advanced than the C1. The C2 features more powerful engines, better suspension, and faster speeds. Because of this, the C2 sold much better than the C1, and the Corvette was no longer in danger of not being made anymore. 
The Corvette C3 was the third Corvette model. It was made from 1968 to 1982. The C3 was very similar to the C2. The main changes were the body and the inside. The V8 engines from the C2 became more powerful. In 1971, because the engines were too bad for the environment, the engines' power went down. This made the C3 slightly slower and less powerful. Every year the engines became less powerful until 1975. This was because the U.S. government forced GM (General Motors) to make the engines better for the environment. The C3 Corvette convertible was not made after 1975, so only the coupe was for sale after 1975. 
The Corvette C4 was the fourth Corvette model. It was made from 1984 to 1996. There were no 1983 Corvettes, except for a few made by Chevrolet that were used for testing. The C4 was the first time the Corvette was totally new. The C4 used many of the same engines as the C3 Corvette, but the body was totally new. The Corvette was made as a convertible again starting in 1986. 1986 was also the year the Corvette was a pace car for the Indianapolis 500 car race. Throughout the C4's life, new engines and transmissions were used. The C4 ZR-1 was a special edition of the C4, which was much faster than the normal C4. It was made from 1990 to 1995. 
The Corvette C5 was the fifth Corvette model. It was made from 1997 to 2004. The C5 was much better than the C4 Corvette. The C5 had a new body, many new engines, and a better chassis. Because of the better engines and more aerodynamic body, the C5 Corvette The C5 was also much faster than the C4, and it had a top speed of 181 mph (miles per hour). The 1997 model was only available as a coupé with removable roof parts (known as a "targa" "top"), but in 1998 the Corvette convertible came on sale. Starting in 1999, a fixed-roof coupé went on sale. It is like the coupé but with a completely solid roof. It is sometimes called the "FRC." In 2001, a faster C5 was made, called the Z06. The Z06 was faster than the C4 ZR-1, which it replaced. There was also a race car version of the C5, called the C5-R. 
The Corvette C6 was the sixth Corvette model. It was made from 2005 to 2013. The C6 was a fairly large improvement over the C5. Some of the changes were exposed headlights, better suspension, and a much better interior. The C6 was also faster than the C5. Starting in 2008, the C6 got a new engine that had 430 horsepower. This made the car even faster. Like the C5, the C6 had a Z06 model. The C6 Z06 had a very big engine and was very light for a Corvette. This made the Z06 very fast. Also, there was a model called the ZR1, which was even faster. The ZR1 featured a supercharged engine and was even faster than the Z06. The ZR1 is sometimes called the "Blue Devil". It is the fastest Corvette C6. The ZR1 was first made in 2008. Like the C5, there was a race car version of the C6, called the C6.R. 
The Corvette C7 is the seventh Corvette model, and it is being made now. It was first made in 2014. It is known as the Corvette Stingray. The C7 is more advanced than the C6, and has a much nicer inside. The main engine is very similar to the one in the C6, but is now more powerful. The body of the C7 is different from other Corvettes. It has bigger headlights, very different back lights, and many more vents. The Corvette C7 is also available as a convertible. Like the C5 and C6, the C7 has a Z06 model. The Z06 is even faster than the C6 ZR1, and it has a supercharged engine. This engine makes 650 horsepower in the Z06. There is also a Z06 convertible for the first time ever. Like the C5 and C6, there is a C7 race car, which is called the C7.R.

Eine kleine Nachtmusik

Eine kleine Nachtmusik is the name given to the Serenade No. 13 for strings in G major, K 525 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It is one of his most popular pieces and the opening tune is heard in many places, e.g. on mobile phones.It was composed in 1787 and is a serenade for strings.
The title "Eine kleine Nachtmusik" means literally: "A little Night Music". "Nachtmusik" was a title which was often given to serenades in the 18th century. A serenade in the 18th century was a lighthearted piece of music, often played during feasts. This serenade is written for two violins, viola, and cello and possibly a double bass as well. It is either performed as a string quartet (just four players) or by a small group of instruments, in which case at least one double bass is normally added.
There are four movements:
The first movement has this famous opening tune:
The movement is in sonata form. A short while after the famous opening theme comes a second theme which is more graceful and in D major, the dominant key of G major. The first part (exposition) closes in D major and is repeated. The next part (development section) begins on D major and goes to other keys before the music returns to G major for the last part (recapitulation).
The second movement is a "Romanza". It is marked "Andante" ("at a walking pace"). It is gentler and slower than the first movement. Three tunes are heard during the movement, which has an ABACA structure.
The third movement is a minuet and trio (ABA) in G major.
The fourth and last movement is in sonata rondo form. This finale returns with the liveliness of the first movement.

Super Bowl XXXIV

Super Bowl XXXIV (or Super Bowl 34) was a Super Bowl game between the St. Louis Rams and the Tennessee Titans in the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 1999 regular season. The Rams won against the Titans 23–16. The game was played on January 30, 2000 at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia.
It is best remembered for the final play of the game, where Mike Jones of St Louis tackled Kevin Dyson of Tennessee at the one yard line as time ran out, thus stopping Tennessee from scoring a touchdown that could have tied the game.
Both teams did not play well early on in the game. St. Louis went inside the "Red zone" (the final 20 yards) of Tennessee's half six times in the first half, but only scored four times - three field goals, and one touchdown. They missed one field goal try, and had to abort another due to a bad snap. Tennessee also missed a field goal in the fist half. This gave St Louis a 16-0 lead at half time.
In the second half, Tennessee fought back, with two Touchdowns - but only scored the extra point on one of them, and then tied the game with a field goal.
St. Louis then scored in just one play to take the lead again, 23-16, with fewer than two minutes left.
With only one time-out remaining, Tennessee tried to drive into the End zone to score a touchdown that could have tied the game if they made the extra point. However, after using their time-out with just six seconds left, the final play had Kevin Dyson tackled at the one yard line. The time ran out, and St. Louis won the game.
St. Louis quarterback Kurt Warner was named the game's Most Valuable Player (MVP).

Flemish Brabant (Dutch: "Vlaams-Brabant", French: "Brabant flamand") is the youngest and smallest province of the Flemish Region, one of the three regions of Belgium. It covers the Dutch-speaking northern part of the former province of Brabant. Flemish Brabant also completely surrounds the Brussels-Capital Region, which forms an enclave within the territory of the province.
Its capital, and also the largest city of the province, is the university city of Leuven (, often used in English).
"Flemish" in "Flemish Brabant" means that it is in the Flemish part of the former province of Brabant of Belgium. "Brabant" was an old region, the Duchy of Brabant. The word "Brabant" appears for the first time in the seventh century when the abbey of Nivelles was founded in the "pagus Bracbatensis" ("pagus" is a Latin word meaning a very small town, with only few houses).
Flemish Brabant was created in 1995 by the splitting of the former province of Brabant into three parts: two new provinces, Flemish Brabant and Walloon Brabant; and the Brussels-Capital Region, which no longer belongs to any province. The split was made to accommodate the eventual division of Belgium in three regions (Flanders, Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region).
The province borders on (clockwise from the North) the Belgian provinces of Antwerp, Limburg, Liège, Walloon Brabant, Hainaut and East Flanders.
The province has an area of ; it is about long (east-west direction) and about wide (north-south direction).

A Network interface card, NIC, or Network card is an electronic device that connects a computer to a computer network, usually a LAN. It is considered a piece of computer hardware. Today, most computers have network cards. Network cards enable a computer to exchange data with the network. To achieve the connection, network cards use a suitable protocol, for example CSMA/CD. Network cards usually implement the first two layers of the OSI model, that is the physical layer, and the data link layer. Today, most network cards use Ethernet. Other network types are ARCNET, introduced in 1977, LocalTalk or Token Ring. There are many network cards which are compatible to only respective software. 
Some network cards do not use a cable to connect to the network, but an antenna. Network cards commonly use a number of protocols called IEEE 802.11, popularly known as Wireless LAN or Wi-Fi. Bluetooth is another method of wireless communication, usually over a short distance.

Genogram

A genogram is a family tree with medical details, such as whether the person is male or female, and whether brothers and sisters are twins. Genograms help medics understand a person better.
One of the advantages of a genogram is the ability to use colour-coded lines to define different types of relationships such as family relationships, emotional relationships and social relationships. Within family relationships, you can illustrate if a couple is married, divorced, common-law, engaged, etc.

Bookcase

A bookcase, or bookshelf, is a piece of furniture that is used to hold books.
Bookcases can be different sizes, from a small single shelf to a large bookcase that can fill an entire wall.
Libraries have many bookcases holding books on many different topics.
In imperial China, there were revolving bookcases. They are described in 8th- and 9th-century Chinese writings. They were popular in Buddhist monasteries during the Song Dynasty. A revolving bookcase is shown in Li Jie's "Yingzao Fashi".
Books used to be written by hand. Not many of them were made. At that time, they were kept in small boxes or chests. The boxes or chests were carried around with the owners. When people started having a lot of books and other manuscripts, they kept them on shelves or in cupboards. Later the cupboard doors were removed. The cupboards then looked like today's bookcases.
The oldest bookcases in England are in the Bodleian Library at Oxford University. Those were put there near the end of the 16th century.

<doc id="119688" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=119688" title="Spreadsheet">
Spreadsheet

A Spreadsheet is a computer program that imitates a paper worksheet. It shows a large sheet (like a sheet of paper) that has many cells in a grid of rows and columns. Users can put words or numbers into the cells, to make headings and store information (usually numbers). You can also move the grid lines around so that some cells are bigger than others, and change the color or size of text/font, the same way font/text is changed in a word processor. You can even put pictures in the worksheets, make multiple pages, and print out their results on real paper.
The primary reason most people use spreadsheets is for automatic calculations. Spreadsheets can be designed to add up the items/amounts on a bill, calculate sales tax, and even calculate income tax. A user can add and subtract the numbers here, even if the numbers are not next to each other. This means the computer does all the math, and people only need to give the correct information.
Another strength of spreadsheets, is that they can produce diagrams, like graphs and pie-charts, based on the data the user enters. Sometimes the numbers make more sense when the computer turns them into a picture.

Space Invasion

Space Invasion is a text-based online browser game. Space Invasion is a Space-strategy themed game. It currently has over 500,000 Players. Space Invasion was created by the company Bigpoint.
There are 4 types of resources. They are:
Pig Iron is for upgrading buildings and also to help create Metal.
Metal is harder, more resistant and more mouldable than pig iron, and is used mostly for ship construction and better structures. This is the most used substance in the game
Kryptonite is used for almost all types of ships and buildings. It's also used for research.
Spice is a mostly a rare raw material. As a result, it is that much more valuable. Spice provides a good performance in ship drives, in research and also in alloys. Spice even plays a vital role in food production. It is essential for an up-and-coming empire.
In this game you can trade the various resources with the rule of thumb being 6:3:4:1 in the order Pig Iron, Metal, Kryptonite, Spice.
e.g. 6k Pig Iron would be traded for 3k Metal, or 4k Kyrptonite, or 1k Spice.
Mining is the first task you start in the game. In order to mine the four resources you must upgrade each mine. Every upgrade increases the amount of resources the mine produces every hour. But every upgrade uses more energy. So accordingly you must also upgrade the Fusion Plant, which produces energy for the mines. 
Every upgrade uses another field. On your first planet there is 230 fields.
This is the second possibility after mining. You can build and upgrade the Development Center which decreases your building times for factories and such. The research lab unlocks different types of research, and decreases research times. The weapons factory is needed for all ships and defenses. With every level the weapons factory decreases production time.

<doc id="119715" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=119715" title="Stromatolite">
Stromatolite

Stromatolites are special rock-like structures. They usually form in shallow water. 
They are formed by bacteria such as cyanobacteria. There may also be other types of bacteria and single-celled algae. 
The mucus secreted by the bacteria collects grains of sediment, and they are stuck together with calcium carbonate, also from the bacteria. This builds up into the structures seen in certain sea-shore bays. Cyanobacteria use water, carbon dioxide, and sunlight to create their food, and put out oxygen as a by-product. 
The real significance of stromatolites is that they are the earliest fossil evidence of life on Earth. The oldest stromatolites are dated to 3,450 million years ago, during the Archaean eon.
The ability of cyanobacteria to perform oxygenic photosynthesis is highly significant. Early cyanobacteria in stromatolites are thought to be largely responsible for increasing the amount of oxygen in the primaeval Earth's atmosphere through their continuing photosynthesis. They were the first known organisms to photosynthesis and produce free oxygen. After about a billion years, the effect of this photosynthesis began to a huge change in the atmosphere. The process, called the Great Oxygenation Event, actually took a long time. Eventually, it killed off most of the organisms which could not live in oxygen, and led to the kinds of environment we know today, where most organisms use and need oxygen.

Makemake (officially known as 136472 Makemake) is a dwarf planet. It was discovered on March 31, 2005 by astronomers Michael E. Brown, Chad Trujillo and David Rabinowitz. It was announced as a dwarf planet on June 11, 2008, and the discovery of a moon was announced on April 26, 2016. Makemake is a Trans-Neptunian object, because it orbits the Sun further out than Neptune.
It is called Makemake after the god of the ancient civilization that lived on Easter island.
Originally the object was given a codename 'Easterbunny' as it was discovered shortly after Easter. The International Astronomical Union gave it the name Makemake, the creator god of the Easter Island people, to keep its connection with Easter.
Makemake appears to be made mainly of ice and rock. However, at its very low temperature, ice is as hard as many types of rock.

Amendment

An amendment is a formal or official change made to a law, contract, constitution, or other legal document. It is based on the verb to amend, which means to change. Amendments can add, remove, or update parts of these agreements. They are often used when it is better to change the document than to write a new one.
Contracts are often amended when the market changes. For example, a contract to deliver something to a customer once a month can be amended if the customer wants it delivered once a week. Usually, everyone involved in the contract must agree to the amendment before it goes into effect. Most contracts are written with rules about amendments, like if they are allowed, who must agree to them, and when they go into effect. 
Constitutions are often amended when people change their minds about what the government should do. Some of the most famous constitutional amendments are the First Amendment to the United States Constitution which added the freedom of speech, religion, press, and protest, and the Third Amendment to the Constitution of Ireland, which let Ireland join the European Union. Constitutional amendments usually must be approved by both the parliament or legislature and a referendum - a vote by all citizens in a country.
In parliamentary procedure, the way that many meetings are run, an amendment is a type of motion - a proposal or formal suggestion to do something. Amendments can remove words, add words, or change words from motions. Usually, any motion can be amended, even other amendments. However, an amendment to an amendment of an amendment is often not allowed.

Precambrian

Pre-cambrian (or Precambrian) is a term used to describe the eons before the Cambrian. It lasted from about 4.567 billion years ago to about 542 million years ago. It starts with the beginning of the Earth, about 4.567 billion years ago. When it ends, there were many hard-shelled animals around. It is named after the Roman name for Cymru / Wales, because rocks thought to be from this time were first studied there.
The supereon is subdivided into 3 eons, the Hadean (4.5 to 4 billion years ago), the Archaean (4 to 2.5 billion years) and the Proterozoic (from 2.5 billion years to 542 million years).
The immediate Precambrian period is the Ediacaran.

Presidents' Trophy

The Presidents' Trophy is an award presented by the National Hockey League (NHL) to the team that finishes with the most points in the league during the regular season. If two teams tie for the most points, then the trophy goes to the team with the most wins. The winning team is also awarded $350,000 in cash bonuses. The Presidents' Trophy has been awarded 27 times to 15 different teams since first being awarded in 1985. The most recent winner is the New York Rangers for the NHL season.
The trophy was introduced at the start of the 1985–86 NHL season by the league's Board of Governors. Before the 1985–86 NHL season, the best team in the league during the regular season was allowed to hang a banner stating "NHL League Champions". The winning team is also awarded 350,000 Canadian dollars, to be shared between the team and its players. The Presidents' Trophy winner is guaranteed home-ice advantage in all four rounds of the Stanley Cup playoffs, provided the team goes that far, so it remains the most likely position to produce the cup winner.
From 1937 to 1968, the same rules now used for winning the Presidents' Trophy were used to award the Prince of Wales Trophy. With the Modern Era expansion in the 1967–68 season and the start of the West Division, the Wales Trophy was awarded to the team that finished in first place in the East Division during the regular season. However, no trophy was awarded to the team that finished with the best overall record in the league during this period, and no trophy at all was awarded from the 1981–82 season through the 1984–85 season; the Wales and Campbell trophies were transferred to the playoff champions of those conferences in 1981–82. A cash bonus was given to each player on the team with the league's best regular-season record during these years, to which the Presidents' Trophy was added in 1985–86.
The only team to have won the Presidents' Trophy more than twice is the Detroit Red Wings, with six. However, the Montreal Canadiens have finished first overall 21 times, the most times in league history, although they have yet to win the Presidents' Trophy. Detroit is second with 18 first-overall finishes.

Prince of Wales Trophy

<onlyinclude>
The Prince of Wales Trophy, or simply the Wales Trophy, is a National Hockey League (NHL) trophy awarded to the Eastern Conference (formerly the Wales Conference) playoff champions. The trophy is awarded prior to the final series which are the championship games to decide the winner for the Stanley Cup against the Western Conference's champions. The trophy was first established in the 1923-24 NHL season, for the champion of the NHL playoffs, but it has been the trophy for eight different accomplishments, which also include being the NHL regular season champions, American Division regular season champions, regular season champions, East Division regular season champions, Wales Conference regular season champions, Wales Conference playoffs champions, and Eastern Conference playoffs champions. The current holder of the Prince of Wales Trophy is the Tampa Bay Lightning after defeating the New York Rangers in the 2015 Eastern Conference finals. 
The Prince of Wales Trophy was donated by His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII and the Duke of Windsor), in 1924. It was first presented to the playoff champion of the NHL (replacing the O'Brien Trophy) who then went on to face the Western Hockey League (WHL) champion for the Stanley Cup.
After the WHL folded and the Stanley Cup was awarded only to the NHL playoff champion, the Prince of Wales Trophy was awarded to the regular season champion. From 1927–28 onwards it was awarded to the champion of the NHL American Division while the O'Brien Trophy was awarded to the NHL Canadian Division. It was then repurposed to being the trophy for the overall regular season champion in the 1938-39 NHL season when the NHL reverted to a single division.
With the Modern Era expansion in the 1967–68 season and the creation of the West Division, the Wales Trophy was awarded to the team that finished in first place in the East Division during the regular season. When the league formed two conferences in the season of 1974–75, the award was transferred to the team that finished with the best regular-season record in the Wales Conference. Starting with the 1981–82 campaign, when the league changed its playoff format so that the two teams meeting in the Stanley Cup finals could no longer come from the same conference, the trophy was presented to the Wales Conference playoff champions, and since the 1993–94 season, the Eastern Conference playoff champions have won the award.
Once awarded, the deputy commissioner, currently Bill Daly, would present the trophy to the winning team's captain. However, a traditional superstition that is prevalent among many of today's NHL players is that no player should either touch or hoist the Wales Trophy (or the Western Conference's trophy, the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl) when they have won the conference playoffs as the Eastern Conference champions. Players feel that the Stanley Cup is the only true championship trophy and thus it should be the only trophy that should be hoisted.
"Refers to the original Ottawa Senators NHL franchise (1917–1934)."

Pet Sounds

Pet Sounds is the eleventh studio album by the American band, The Beach Boys. The album was released in 1966. 
The album was very popular because it was different from most of the band's other music. Most of The Beach Boys' albums before it had all been about surfing, summer, cars, girls, and fun. They were all quite basic in their music. They were mostly Rock and roll and surf music. "Pet Sounds" was different because of its more complex arrangements;. The bass player for the band, Brian Wilson used a system of recording songs that was different than the system they had used before. In the recording, stringed and wind instruments were used. They also used instruments that were very unusual for rock music. These included vibraphones, harps, French horns, harpsichords, electro-theremins. Also, things like bicycle whistles, and Coca Cola cans with stones inside of them were used. The lyrics of the songs were more serious. They talked about the problems, disappointments and sadness of a young man. Because all the songs had a similar mood and themes, it is considered to be a concept album.
Much of the album was recorded by Wilson himself using professional studio musicians. - people who are hired to play songs for an album. Some of the other band members did not like this. They felt he was ignoring their talents. Mike Love thought that it would be too hard to play these songs live and that their fans would not understand the songs. 
After the album was released, "Pet Sounds" did not sell very well. It reached #10 in the American hit-parade. Wilson felt this was a failure but music critics loved it. The album got real recognition in 1990s-2000s, when many music magazines listed it in their lists of the best albums in popular music (New Musical Express, Rolling Stone, Melody Maker, Mojo Magazine).
Wilson decided to make another album in the same way. The new album, he called "Smile".

Smile (album)

Smile was an album by The Beach Boys. Their bass player Brian Wilson wanted the album to be the follow-up to the album "Pet Sounds". For some reasons, it was not released for over 30 years.
After seeing the success that "Pet Sounds" had been, Wilson wanted to make an album that was even better. In late 1966, he started work on what he said would be "the greatest rock album ever made." He asked Van Dyke Parks to write words for new songs. 
"Smile" was not completed on time for at least three reasons:
When the time came to release the album, Brian said that the album was not finished and would be delayed for an unknown length of time. People still hoped that he would finish it, but in May 1967, the album was cancelled. Wilson had stopped working on it and said it would never be finished.
Later in 1967, The Beach Boys released another album called "Smiley Smile". The album had songs that were written for "Smile". "Smiley Smile" was not the great success that Wilson thought "Smile" would have been. The Beach Boys lost many fans because of the album's failure. The failure also cost Capitol Records much money because not enough people bought the album.
As Carl lamented, they tried for a homerun with "Smile", and ended up hitting a bunt with "Smiley Smile".
In 2004, Brian finished "Smile". The album was a success. People were happy that "Smile" could finally be heard as it was meant to be heard.

<doc id="119876" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=119876" title="Greek Salad">
Greek Salad

Greek salad (Greek: "χωριάτικη σαλάτα", ), 'country/village salad', is a dish from Greece. It is commonly served as a part of a traditional Greek meal. It is one of the most popular salads in Greece and Cyprus. This is because it is light, refreshing and easy to make. It is especially popular during the summer months. True Greek salad is essentially a tomato salad made of sliced or chopped tomatoes with a few slices of cucumber, and red onion. It is usually seasoned with salt, black pepper, and oregano and dressed with olive oil. Common additions include feta cheese, bell peppers, capers, anchovies, sardines and kalamata olives. Lettuce and vinegar are not used in a Greek salad. 
A lettuce salad (called μαρούλι, "lettuce") is a different salad. It is also popular, especially in the autumn and spring. It is made of finely sliced lettuce, scallions, and fresh dill, and dressed with salt, black pepper, olive oil and red wine vinegar or lemon juice.
In North America, Australia, South Africa and the United Kingdom, "Greek salad" has a different meaning: It is a lettuce salad, with Greek-inspired ingredients. The dressing is usually vinegar and oil. Lettuce, tomatoes, feta, and olives are the most standard elements in an American "Greek" salad, but cucumbers, bell peppers, onions, radishes, dolmades, anchovies/sardines and pickled hot peppers are common. In the Detroit, Michigan area, for example, a "Greek salad" also includes beets. Rather than simple olive oil and vinegar, as in a μαρούλι - lettuce salad, prepared dressings containing various herbs and seasonings are frequently used. This style of "Greek salad" is rarely encountered in Greece except in the homes of American Greeks or restaurants that cater to tourists. In these countries, the true Greek salad, when encountered, may be called by the Greek term horiatiki—pronounced [hɔːriː'ætɪkiː]—or by such terms as "country salad", "peasant salad", or "village salad", to avoid confusion. 
Greek salad is also found in other European countries for example Germany (where it is often called "Bauernsalat", literally "farmers' salad"), France (salade à la Grecque), Hungary (görög saláta) and Spain (ensalada griega).
Various other salads have also been called "Greek" in the English language in the last century. Some of them have a very old connection to Greek cuisine. For example, one 1938 American recipe called for a mayonnaise-dressed lettuce salad with shredded cabbage, carrots, and diced smoked herring (rega/renga).
The salads of Greek cuisine are wide and varied. Each region of Greece has or has had a salad specific to the village or area. The most common, described above, start most meals today in Greece at home or when dining out. Others include:
Some spreads and dips found in the meze of Greek cuisine are also affectionately called 'salad' in Greek. Melitzanosalata (Greek: μελιτζανοσαλάτα), is an eggplant 'puree' that includes olive oil, red wine vinegar, flat-leaf parsley and garlic (with regional variations). Taramosalata (Greek: ταραμοσαλάτα) is fish roe mixed with lemon juice, onions, and olive oil, and breadcrumbs or mashed potato.

Homo habilis (also known as "handy man") is one of the early ancestors of modern man who used primitive stone tools. Their remains have been found in the Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania. They are believed to be about 2 million years old. The flat face and large molars of the "Homo habilis" resemble the Australopithecus lineage. The brain size of the "Homo habilis" is about 700 cc (larger than the Australopithecus). An "apelike" (long arms and a small body) body structure was characteristic of the "Homo habilis". They are believed to have been about 1.3 metres tall, and weigh about 37 kilograms. There is still a lot of argument between scientists about the species. They can not all agree on the characteristics, or whether it is even a separate species at all.

<doc id="119906" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=119906" title="Books of Kings">
Books of Kings

The Books of Kings are a set of books in the Old Testament. Both Judaism and Christianity see it as a part of the Bible. The Books of Kings describes the history of Israel's kings from the end of the rule of David until the time of the Babylonian exile (so it writes about a time of about 453 years). After a long description of Solomon's rule, 1,2 Kings writes of how the kingdom of Israel was divided and then shows how the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah developed.
1 and 2 Kings, like 1 and 2 Samuel and 1 and 2 Books of Chronicles are actually one book. It was simply called "Kings." However, it was divided into two books by the translators of the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Old Testament), and so it was written as 1 and 2 Kings by the Latin translation and many other versions.
The division between 1 and 2 Kings was made after the death of Ahab in the northern kingdom (22:37) and Jehoshaphat in the southern kingdom (22:50).
It is not known for sure who is the author (writer) of 1,2 Kings. Jewish tradition says that Jeremiah wrote 1,2 Kings, but people do not usually think so today. Whoever the author was, he knew the book of Deuteronomy, like many of Israel's prophets. He also used lots of sources, like "the books of the annals of Solomon" (11:41, NIV), "the book of the annals of the kings of Israel" (14:19 NIV), and "the book of the annals of the kings of Judah" (14:29 NIV)". Probably other sources were used, like those inside Chronicles).
1,2 Kings gives lots of chronological information. The length of time each king rules is given, and often other information is given, such as the age of the ruler at the time of becoming king.
By putting in Biblical data with those given from Assyrian chronological records, the year 853 B.C. is probable as the year of Ahab's death, and the year 841 as the year Jehu began to reign. So, it can be known that the division of the kingdom happened in 930 B.C., and that Samaria was defeated by the Assyrians in 722-721, and that Jerusalem fell to the Babylonians in 586.
The information about the connection between the reigns of the kigns of Israel and Judah have some problems, which have, for a long time, been wondered at. Recently, though, most of these problems have been solved by recognizing things like possibilities of reigns that overlap, sons ruling "with" their fathers, differences in the time of the year in which the rule of a king officially began, and differences in the way a king's first year was seen.
1,2 Kings does not exactly say its purpose or theme, but it is most probable that the author wanted to write his material as a sequel, the next book after the books of Samuel: a history about the kings by covenant.
The writer was not trying to show a social, or political, or economical history of Israel's kings like most histories today. He writes about Omri, who was a very powerful king and an important political person, in only six verses (16:23-28), simply saying that he "did evil in the eyes of the Lord" (16:25, NIV). Also, Jeroboam the second, who was king over northern Israel when it was most powerful, is written about very shortly (2 Kings 14:23-29).
He also writes nothing about the first years of Josiah king of Judah, but says a long description of how they begin again to keep the covenant in his 18th year as king (2 Kings 22:3-23:28). Nothing is said about why Josiah fought with Pharaoh Neco of Egypt at Megiddo.
The kings who is most written about in the books of Kings are the kings who either kept the covenant well, broke it very badly, or had an important encounter with one of God's prophets. Ahab son of Omri and Manasseh broke the covenant so that it was dangerous to Israel, so the author wrote a lot about them both; Hezekiah (2 Kings 18:1-20:21) and Josiah (2 Kings 22:1 - 23:29) are written a lot about because they tried to remind the people of their covenant promises. They are the only two kings who the writer is really happy with for their loyalty to the Lord.
Another important part of 1 and 2 Kings is that the writer shows the relationship between prophecy and how it is fulfilled (comes true) in history. At least 11 prophecies are written to be true. The writer also shows the importance of the prophets as messengers from God to tell the kings and people of Israel to come back to God. Uusally, nobody listened to their warnings (for example, Ahijah, Shemaiah, Micaiah, Jonah, Isaiah, Huldah), but the writer writes very much about Elijah and Elisha.

Books of the Bible

The Books of the Bible are the different sections of the Bible. Each book has a different name. Most of the time the book is named after the person who maybe wrote the book. Although that is not always the case. Different religions, and different denominations of Christianity, have different books or sections in the Bible. These different groups accept different books. These groups also use different names for the same books. The stories in the "Books of the Bible" are very similar for all religious groups. Some people use a trick and ideas to memorize the Bible. 
Below, there is a list or table that compares the Books of the Bible in Judaism and in the Catholic, Protestant, Greek Orthodox, Slavonic Orthodox, Georgian, Armenian Apostolic, Syriac, and Ethiopian Churches. The table covers both the Old Testament and the New Testament. For a detailed discussion of the differences, see "Biblical canon".
The Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and Eastern Catholic churches may have small differences in the lists of books that they accept. If at least one Eastern church accepts a book, then that book is listed in this table. The Eastern churches accept all of the books that the Roman Catholic Church accepts.
If a table cell has an asterisk (*), it means that a book is used, but in a different order. Empty cells mean that the book is not used. These books are often called "apocrypha". This word is sometimes used specifically (and possibly negatively) to describe the books in the Catholic and Orthodox canon that are not in the Protestant Bible. Orthodox and Catholic Christians call these books "deuterocanonical", which means second canon.
Most Christian groups agree about the New Testament canon (the list of books in the New Testament) but some groups put books in a different order (place). 
The Ethiopian Orthodox Church has a few other books in its canon (list of books): Jubilees, Book of Enoch, and The Rest of the Words of Baruch (4 Baruch).
The Peshitta does not have 2-3 John, 2 Peter, Jude, and Revelation, but Bibles of the modern Syriac Orthodox Church do have later translations of those books. They also have the Letter of Baruch (Baruch, is called a deuterocanonical book of the Bible). Today the Syrian Orthodox Church only uses lessons from the twenty-two books of Peshitta in its official lectionary (list of Church readings). 
Third Epistle to the Corinthians was once part of the Armenian Orthodox Bible, but it is not in modern editions (printed versions). 
The Anglican Church accepts the same order of books as the Vulgate (Catholic 16th Century) Bible. The 39 Articles (an Anglican list of doctrines or important beliefs) says that these Books of the Bible are Apocrypha:

Bambi's Children

Bambi's Children, The Story of a Forest Family () is a book written by Felix Salten, first printed and translated from German to English in 1939. It is a sequel to Salten's book "Bambi, A Life in the Woods". It was first published in German only in the following year.
The main characters are Bambi's twin fawns, Geno, male, and Gurri, female; it also stars their friends, another pair of fawns named Lana and Boso. Lana and Boso are the children of Aunt Rolla, a doe met later in the course of the novel. Two more new characters are introduced—Nello and Membo, the orphans. The overall storyline is how Geno and Gurri learn the pleasures as well as downsides of nature and their forest home. "Bambi, A Life in the Woods", the original story of Bambi, is much darker than the sequel. Unlike its predecessor, "Bambi's Children" ends when Geno begins to grow his antlers, whereas "Bambi, A Life in the Woods" continues until Bambi's children are born. In the end, Faline, knowing the time is right, sends off her children to live their own lives.
What may be interesting to readers is that it is not possible to determine whether "Bambi's Children" is a sequel to the book "Bambi" or a midquel as there are no references to the former which makes one able to place the latter. The language of "Bambi's Children" is more gentle than that of "Bambi, A Life in the Woods".

Roosevelt and Secretary of State Cordell Hull declared the so-called Good Neighbor Policy which opposed U.S. armed intervention in inter-American affairs. Franklin D. Roosevelt tried to reverse the perception of "Yankee imperialism" with this treaty. The view of Yankee imperialism was brought about by policies instituted (largely) by his predecessor, President Herbert Hoover. The convention was signed by 19 states, three with reservations (Brazil, Peru and the United States).
The convention is about what is a state and what rights and duties it has. Most well-known is article 1, which sets out the four criteria for statehood that have sometimes been recognized as an accurate statement of customary international law:
In addition, the first sentence of article 3 explicitly states that "The political existence of the state is independent of recognition by the other states." This is known as the declarative theory of statehood.
Some have questioned whether these criteria are sufficient, as they allow less-recognized entities like the Republic of China (Taiwan) or even entirely non-recognized entities like the Principality of Sealand to claim full status as states. According to the alternative constitutive theory of statehood, a state exists only insofar as it is recognized by other states. It should not be confused with the Estrada doctrine.
There have also been attempts to further broaden the convention's definition, although they have gained less support. Founders of non-territorial micronations commonly assert that the requirement in the Montevideo Convention of a defined territory is in some way wrong-headed, for largely unspecified reasons. Some non-territorial entities, notably the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, are indeed considered subjects of international law, but these do not aspire to statehood.
The states that signed this convention are: Honduras, United States of America, El Salvador, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Argentina, Venezuela, Uruguay, Paraguay, Mexico, Panama, Guatemala, Brazil, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Cuba.
The Montevideo Convention only codified existing norms, there is nothing "new" in the convention. For this reason, it does not only apply to those who signed it, but to all subjects of international law as a whole.
The European Union, in the principal statement of its Badinter Committee, follows the Montevideo Convention in its definition of a state: by having a territory, a population, and a political authority. The committee also found that the existence of states was a question of fact, while the recognition by other states was purely declaratory and not a determinative factor of statehood.
Switzerland, although not a member of the European Union, adheres to the same principle, stating that "neither a political unit needs to be recognized to become a state, nor does a state have the obligation to recognize another one. At the same time, neither recognition is enough to create a state, nor does its absence abolish it."

Folly

In architecture, a folly is a building usually constructed strictly for aesthetic pleasure. Originally, buildings were made to provide shelter or to house people. Follies are just decoration; they no longer have a building's original function.
They were first constructed to put accents into parks and estates. "Folly" is used in the sense of fun or light-heartedness, not in the sense of something ill-advised.
In general, follies have the following properties:
In England, these structures are also called "eye-catchers". This points to their basically decorative nature.
Follies fall within the general realm of fanciful and impractical architecture, and whether a particular structure is a folly is sometimes a matter of opinion. However, there are several types which are related but which can be distinguished from follies.
Follies began as decorative accents on the great estates of the late 16th and early 17th centuries but they flourished especially in the two centuries which followed. Many estates were blessed with picturesque ruins of monastic houses and (in Italy) Roman villas; others, lacking such buildings, constructed their own sham versions of these romantic structures. Such structures were often dubbed "[name of architect or builder]'s Folly", after the single individual who commissioned or designed the project. However, very few follies are completely without a practical purpose. Apart from their decorative aspect, many originally had a use which was lost later, such as hunting towers. Follies are misunderstood structures, according to The Folly Fellowship, a charity that exists to celebrate the history and splendour of these often neglected buildings.
Follies are often found in parks or large grounds of houses and stately homes. Some were deliberately built to look partially ruined. They were especially popular from the end of the 16th century to the 18th century. Theme parks and world's fairs have often contained "follies", although such structures do serve a purpose of attracting people to those parks and fairs.
The Irish Potato Famine of 1845-49 led to the building of several follies. The society of the day held that laissez faire, not a welfare state, was the appropriate form of civil management. The concept of a welfare state was a century away, and at that time reward without labour, even to those in need, was seen as misguided. However, to hire the needy for work on useful projects would deprive existing workers of their jobs. Thus, construction projects termed "famine follies" came to be built. These include: roads in the middle of nowhere, between two seemingly random points; screen and estate walls; piers in the middle of bogs; etc.
Follies can be found worldwide, but there seem to be many in Great Britain.

Pete Seeger

Pete Seeger (Peter Seeger; May 3, 1919 – January 27, 2014) was an American folk musician and songwriter. He was a longtime friend of Woody Guthrie, and founder of The Almanac Singers and The Weavers, two famous folk bands. Seeger's usual musical instrument is a banjo.
Seeger was born Peter Seeger on May 3, 1919 in Manhattan, New York City. His parents were Protestants. His parents enrolled him at Avon Old Farms Boarding School in Avon, Connecticut. Seeger studied for a short while at Harvard University. He soon dropped out. In 1943, Seeger married his wife Toshi Aline.
He organized or played at many benefit concerts, to help people who had been hurt by bad business practices or governmental policies, or sometimes by disasters. He also wrote songs to promote the things he believed in, and to protest things he opposed.
Seeger was a liberal, not afraid to speak his views openly, or to support unpopular causes such as Communism. Seeger's musical career was sometimes limited by his views. The American Federal Bureau of Investigation kept a on Seeger, and the House Un-American Activities Committee put pressure on him, because of his beliefs. He refused to change his views, or to stop doing what he believed was right. Because of this, Seeger was in many places, and could not play music there. He was also not allowed to appear on television for most of the 1950s and 1960s. 
One rare appearance, on the "Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour", was because the song he played, "Waist Deep In The Big Muddy", was an allegory against the Vietnam War, which most Americans supported at the time.
Seeger's original songs include "Where Have All The Flowers Gone?", "The Hammer Song" (also called "If I Had A Hammer"), and "Turn, Turn, Turn", whose words were adapted from Ecclesiastes in the Bible. Other musicians played and recorded his songs, including Judy Collins, Peter, Paul and Mary, and The Byrds. Seeger started "Broadside", a magazine devoted to folk music, and also "Sing Out!" to promote music and singing by the public.
As years went by, social trends changed in America, and Seeger's views became more acceptable. He was finally able to make television appearances, and was admired for his to folk music, and to causes. He played music together with Arlo Guthrie, the son of Woody Guthrie, performing Woody's old songs and others. He received awards for his music, including the American National Medal for the Arts, and a Kennedy Center Honor. He was also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and even the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as an influence to rock musicians.
Seeger and Toshi had four children. He was an active as a musician and as a for important matters, like the environment, , and people who need a to support them. His wife Toshi Seeger died on July 9, 2013. Seeger lived in New York City.
Seeger died in New York City on January 27, 2014, of natural causes, aged 94. His remains were cremated.

Strawberry Fields Forever

"Strawberry Fields Forever" is a song composed by John Lennon, recorded by his band The Beatles in 1966 at Abbey Road Studios, and issued by Parlophone Records and Capitol Records in February 1967, as the to "Penny Lane".
Lennon began work on "Strawberry Fields Forever" while he was in Almería, Spain, during the time he was appearing in a Dick Lester comedy movie, "How I Won the War", which starred Michael Crawford. The lyrics drew on Lennon's memories of Strawberry Field, a Salvation Army home in Liverpool, England, where Lennon went as a boy to with neighborhood friends. "We "always" had fun at Strawberry Fields", he later told Playboy Magazine. They also drew on his feelings of and being different. "No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low" he explained as not being able to find other people who looked at life the way he did.
Lennon's first demo of "Strawberry Fields Forever" was made with a simple tape recorder, by Lennon himself. He explored different of instruments, with the Beatles and George Martin in the recording studio, as they began for "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band". 
One recorded version of the song used a slide guitar. Another used a Mellotron, and was considered a finished work. Lennon wanted to try another arrangement, though, and asked Martin to compose a score for brass instruments, for another session. This was also considered finished.
Lennon could not decide which of the two finished versions of the song was best. He liked how the first one began, but preferred the ending of the second, and asked George Martin if they could be edited together. Martin did not see an easy way to do that, because the key and tempo of each version was different.
It turned out that studio technology made it possible to join the two versions in an effective way. The first version was speeded up on tape, raising its pitch and tempo, and the second slowed down, lowering its pitch and tempo. With edits between verses, Martin changed from one version to the other. Most listeners never noticed the change, or knew about the edit.
To go with the recording, the Beatles filmed a "promo"; an early kind of music video, in January 1967. The band had begun to grow mustaches, and Lennon began to wear eyeglasses in public, which he rarely did before. The changes made the Beatles look very different from how the public saw them earlier. The kind of glasses Lennon wore (sometimes called ""), were issued in England by the and the military, and he wore them making "How I Won the War". Lennon disliked the style as a boy, but now made it a by it.
The Beatles planned to issue "Strawberry Fields Forever" and "Penny Lane" as part of their next album, but EMI asked for a single at the beginning of 1967. The two songs were issued as a single, with "Penny Lane" as the A-side. While "Penny Lane" only reached Number Two in the British record sales chart, it reached Number One in the United States chart. (It was displaced after one week at Number One, by The Turtles, with "Happy Together".) "Strawberry Fields Forever" charted at Number Eight in the US.
It is sometimes believed that "Strawberry Fields Forever" describes or suggests the use of drugs, like LSD or even heroin. Lennon admitted that using LSD and other drugs influenced his songwriting, but made no references to any drug, or drug use, in the song.
In the years after Lennon's death, his cowriter and fellow Beatle Paul McCartney sometimes performed "Strawberry Fields Forever" during concerts. A section of Central Park in New York City, where Lennon lived after the Beatles disbanded, was named "Strawberry Fields" in Lennon's honour.

Lucy (Australopithecus)

Lucy is the common name of AL 288-1. This is a fossil discovery of about 40% of the skeleton of a female "Australopithecus afarensis". There are several hundred pieces of bone. The discovery was made in 1974 at Hadar in the Awash Valley of Ethiopia's Afar Depression. 
This discovery gave us much scientific evidence. Lucy lived about 3.2 million years ago, and is a hominid.
The skeleton shows that Lucy had a small skull capacity, like an ape, but also that she walked upright like a human. This supported the view that bipedalism came before the increase in brain size in human evolution. Those features are true of all australopithecines.

<doc id="120040" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=120040" title="Italian Mare Nostrum">
Italian Mare Nostrum

Italian Mare Nostrum was the name given during World War II, by Benito Mussolini and his fascist propaganda to the Mediterranean Sea, under the domination of the Kingdom of Italy.
The Mediterranean was called "Mare Nostrum" (Latin for "Our Sea") during the centuries of the Roman Empire, an empire that Fascism intended to recreate after the conquest of Ethiopia in 1936.
Mussolini wanted to re-establish the greatness of the Roman Empire and believed that Italy was the most powerful of the Mediterranean countries after World War I. He declared that "the twentieth century will be a century of Italian power" and created one of the most powerful navies of the world in order to control the Mediterranean Sea.
However, the nation that really dominated the Mediterranean in 1940 was the United Kingdom, as the British had strong naval bases in Gibraltar, Malta and Cyprus. The British also controlled the Suez Canal, along with the French; the "French Third Republic" had a relatively powerful navy, and controlled the African Maghreb. Only after the conquest of Greece and Yugoslavia, in April 1941, Mussolini started to talk about an Italian dominated Mediterranean sea.
In 1942 Mussolini dreamed to create a "Greater Italia" in his "Mare Nostrum" and promoted the fascist project -to be realized in a future peace conference after the expected Axis victory- of an enlarged "Italian Empire", stretching from the Mediterranean shores of Egypt to the Indian Ocean shores of Somalia and eastern Kenya. All these projects disappeared with the final Italian defeat of September 1943.
Italy controlled (directly or indirectly) the seashores of these Mediterranean countries, when Mussolini spoke and boasted of an "Italian Mare Nostrum" in 1941/1942/1943:
When France collapsed in 1940, Mussolini started to expand the Italian maritime control on the central Mediterranean, attacking British possessions. The ensuing "Battle of the Mediterranean" had many changes of fortune and finished with the victory of the Allies.
There were a series of surface actions (e.g., Battle of Cape Matapan, Battle of Punta Stilo, Battle of Cape Teulada, Second Battle of Sirte, Battle of Mid-June, Battle of Mid-August ) between Allied navies and the Italian Regia Marina, during which the British, able to replace losses with warships redeployed from other theatres, finally gained the upper hand. 
The "Battle of Taranto" in 1940 was a successful air attack on the Italian Navy at anchor when 21 British torpedo bombers sunk one battleship and damaged two others.The Italian Navy slowly recovered from that attack, later copied by the Japanese in Pearl Harbour.
The Italian Navy's most successful attack, however, was when human torpedo divers planted mines on British battleships in Alexandria (Egypt) harbour (19 December 1941), and the HMS "Queen Elizabeth" and HMS "Valiant" were sunk . After these sinkings (and the contemporary destruction of the British "Force K"), the Italian Navy obtained for some months the nearly complete control of the central Mediterranean. In this way the Regia Marina was able to deliver the military supply and oil for the "Axis" victory of Tobruk and for the advance toward El Alamein in Egypt.
The Italian Regia Aeronautica entered the war with 3296 airplanes (1332 Bombers and 1160 "Caccia", as were called the Fighters in Italian) distributed in all the "Italian Empire", but only 1796 were in perfect fighting conditions. Most were old "wood" models, and could not match the British aircraft in 1940. 
But in April 1941, when Italy started together with the Germans the coordinated "Axis" attack in the Mediterranean (in the Balkans and in Libya), the Italian Air Force had the new and competitive "Macchi C.202", able to fight successfully the British Spitfires. These airplanes (with the new "Reggiane Re.2002") took control of the Malta and Libyan airspace (together with the German military aircraft) during the successful campaign of General Rommel in Tobruk. 
Only at the beginning of 1943 appeared the modern "Macchi C.205" and "Reggiane Re.2005", but they could not match the overwhelming superiority of the American Air Force.
One of the most renown and important branches of the Regia Aeronautica was the "torpedo bomber" group. In 1941 and 1942, Italian pilots, mostly flying the three-engined, medium bomber "Savoia-Marchetti SM.79" "Sparviero" , inflicted considerable losses to Allied shipping in the Mediterranean Sea.
The only four engine heavy bomber of the Regia Aeronautica was the "Piaggio P.108" B. In the 274th Long-Range Bombardment group these bombers made many long range bombardments of Gibraltar from Sardinia in summer 1942 and reinforced in this way the Regia Aeronautica supremacy during those of months in the Italian Mare Nostrum.
The Italian Army ("Regio Esercito") entered the war with 73 divisions (and one fascist Legion of "Blackshirts"), but only 19 were fully operational for combat in June 1940. Italy during the first years of WWII had only small and medium tanks ("Fiat M13/40" and "Fiat M15/42"), that were no match for the Allies tanks. Only in summer 1943 the Italians developed a heavy tank (the "P40 tank") , but just 5 were ready for combat when Italy signed the armistice. The Italian Army had good antitanks (like the "Semovente 75/18") and reliable armoured cars (like the "AB 41") .
Slowly the initial Italian setbacks (suffered mainly in the African colonies) were corrected with German help and in spring 1941 the Italians started an offensive in the Balkans (Greece and Yugoslavia) and in North Africa (Libya).
In summer/autumn 1942 Italy controlled the European seashores of the Mediterranean from the Rhone river in occupied France to Mount Olympus in Aegean Greece. A similar situation happened in the African shores of the Mediterranean Sea, where Mussolini's control went from Tunisia to El Alamein in Egypt. This Italian domination was increased by the fact that most of the remaining shores of the Mediterranean were controlled by the fascist Spain of General Franco, the France of "Vichy" and the Turkey of Kemal Atatürk, all of them with friendliness toward Mussolini.
In those months Mussolini referred to the Mediterranean Sea as "Mare Nostrum", in the same manner as the Romans had done when they dominated the Classical World. However, the Roman Mare Nostrum lasted for roughly six hundred years, while Mussolini's Mare Nostrum lasted a few years until the Italian armistice in September 1943.
All the overseas possessions of Italy in the Mediterranean Sea (Dodecanese, Libya, Saseno island, etc.) were lost formally as a result of the Treaty of peace with Italy (1947).
When Italy entered World War II on 10 June 1940, the Italian Royal Navy ("Regia Marina") was the fourth largest navy in the world. The Italian Navy had a mix of modernised and new battleships and challenged the Allies, mostly the British Royal Navy, for supremacy of the Mediterranean Sea. 
Air support was provided by the Italian Air Force Auxiliary to the Navy ("Aviazione Ausiliara per la Marina"), the naval air service during wartime. The Air Force Auxiliary was in charge of all land-based aircraft, shore-based hydroplanes amongst of vessel-based aircraft, and hydroplanes of Italian Navy.
Italian warships had a general reputation as well-designed and good-looking. But some Italian cruiser classes were rather deficient in armour. All Italian warships lacked radar for most of the war, although the lack of radar was partly offset by the fact that Italian warships had good "rangefinder" and "fire-control" systems. In addition, whereas Allied commanders at sea had discretion on how to act, Italian commanders were closely and precisely governed by Italian Naval Headquarters ("Supermarina"). This could lead to action being avoided when the Italians had a clear advantage (e.g., During "Operation Hats" . Italian Naval Headquarters was conscious that the British could replace ships lost in the Mediterranean, whereas Italian Navy resources were limited). 
The Allies had "Ultra" intercepts, which predicted the Italian movements, and radar, which enabled them to locate the ships and range their weapons at distance and at night. The better air reconnaissance skills of the "Fleet Air Arm" and their close collaboration with surface units were other major causes of the initial Italian defeats (like in the "Battle of Cape Matapan").
The most successful attack performed by the Italian Navy involved divers planting mines on British battleships in Alexandria harbour (19 December 1941): HMS "Queen Elizabeth" and HMS "Valiant" were sunk in shallow water by the "maiali" of Luigi Durand De La Penne. 
On the same night, "Force K", comprising three cruisers and four destroyers based at Malta, became stranded in an Italian minefield off Tripoli. A cruiser (HMS "Neptune") and a destroyer (HMS "Kandahar") were lost, three other ships were seriously damaged, and more than 900 men died. "Force K" was put out of action and Malta's offensive capabilities were reduced to a minimum.
This sudden series of Allied defeats allowed the Regia Marina to achieve naval supremacy in the central Mediterranean, her supply routes were almost untouched by the enemy for several months. This is the beginning of nearly one year in which the Mediterranean sea was effectively an "Italian Mare Nostrum".
The Italian fleet also took advantage of the situation and moved onto the offensive, blocking or decimating at least three large Allied convoys bound for Malta. This led to a number of naval engagements, such as the "Second Battle of Sirte", the "Battle of Mid-June" or Operation "Harpoon" (plus Operation "Vigorous") and finally to Operation "Pedestal", all of them favourable to the Axis but sufficient supplies had been delviered to Malta for it to survive as a British base. The biggest success of the Italian Fleet was the aerial and surface attack on the "Harpoon" convoy, which sank several Allied warships and damaged others. Only two transports of the original six reached Malta. This was the only undisputed squadron-size victory for Italian surface forces in World War II. 
During these months the Regia Marina even planned an attack to New York harbour for December 1942, but it was delayed for many reasons and was never done .
However, this was only a brief happy time for Mussolini. The oil and supplies brought to Malta, despite heavy losses, by "Operation Pedestal" in August and the Allied landings in North Africa, "Operation Torch", in November 1942, turned the fortunes of war against Italy. After years of stalemate, the Axis forces were ejected from Libya and Tunisia in six months after the "Battle of El Alamein", while their supply lines were harassed day after day by the growing and overwhelming aerial and naval supremacy of the Allies in what has just been the Mussolini's "Italian Mare Nostrum".
The Regia Marina performed well and bravely in its North African convoy duties, but remained at a technical disadvantage. The Italian ships relied on a speed advantage, but could easily be damaged by shell or torpedo, due to their relatively thin armour. The fatal and final blow to the Italian Navy was a shortage of fuel, which forced her main units to remain at anchor for most of the last year of the Italian alliance with Germany .
From summer/fall 1941 to November 1942 the Mediterranean sea was effectively an "Italian Mare Nostrum". These were the main battles/events in those months:

The Andy Griffith Show

The Andy Griffith Show is an American sitcom television series. The series won no awards, but it was very popular in its day. It was #1 in its final year on the air.
The series is about a sheriff in fictional Mayberry, North Carolina, a friendly, backward town with colorful characters. Andy is a widower with a young son named Opie. His paternal Aunt Bee, lives with them and maintains the home. Andy's friend/cousin (or cousin-in-law), Barney is his oddball deputy/ sidekick.
The show aired on CBS between October 3, 1960 and April 1, 1968. Griffith, Howard, and Bavier were introduced in an episode of "The Danny Thomas Show". The show transitioned to color with the sixth season. The broad, cornball comedy was toned-down and the show was allowed to touch on serious themes.
Don Knotts and Frances Bavier won a combined total of six Emmy Awards. Knotts left the show at the end of its fifth black and white season.
The series had two spin-offs: "Mayberry, RFD", a sitcom series starring Ken Berry as councilman/ farmer Sam Jones and featured most of the characters from the Andy Griffith Show, and "Gomer Pyle, USMC" with filling station worker Gomer (Jim Nabors) becoming a marine. A 1986 NBC TV movie, Return To Mayberry, brought most of the cast members together once again.

Live Free or Die Hard

Live Free or Die Hard (also called Die Hard 4.0 outside of North America) is a 2007 American action movie starring Bruce Willis and Justin Long.
The movie starts with John McClane trying to talk to his daughter Lucy. He pulls her boyfriend out of the car. An angry Lucy goes up to her apartment. Afterwards, the police call McClane and ask him to pick up a kid named Matt Farrell. However, when McClane goes down there, mercenaries attack the two. McClane manages to fight them off and gets Farrell into the car.
Day breaks in Washington, D.C. The villain, Thomas Gabriel, launches his plan. He takes control over all of the things that help run the country, like traffic lights and transportation systems. He shuts down the FBI building and calls in an anthrax alert. He makes the lights go green and red very fast so that cars crash into each other. McClane and Farrell get out and walk to the FBI trailer outside. Farrell realizes that this is a "fire sale" – where everything being taken over by these hackers and it is called a fire sale because "everything must go."
McClane and Farrell then head to Middleton, Virginia, because some systems, like electricity, cannot be taken fully over with computers. However, Mai (Gabriel's girlfriend) is already at the plant and has taken over it. McClane attacks her and throws her to the ground and tells Farrell to put the system back up. Mai gets up and kicks him out of the building. McClane uses a car and rams her and they fight inside an elevator shaft. It ends when the car falls with Mai inside.
Farrell and McClane send a picture of Gabriel to the FBI, where they say that Gabriel was hired by them. Gabriel wanted tighter security, but they said no and fired him. Gabriel contacts the Middleton plant to ask what happened. He gets very angry when McClane tells him that Mai is dead and tells his hackers to send all the natural gas they can to the Middleton plant. He also finds Lucy and kidnaps her. The plant blows up and knocks all the power out in the nearby area. 
McClane and Farrell take a helicopter to Baltimore, Maryland to meet another computer hacker who calls himself The Warlock. He finds out where Gabriel is – at the Social Security Administration building in Woodlawn. Before the government fired him, Gabriel had made a system; when there was a computer attack, all financial data would be downloaded into the computers there. One of Gabriel's men went down there and starts downloading the data early on in the movie.
Both McClane and Farrell head down there. Gabriel takes Farrell and escapes with the data before McClane can reach him. McClane gets into the truck behind Gabriel's car. Gabriel calls in a jet fighter to attack McClane. During the fight, the highway is destroyed, but McClane manages to jump off and slide to safety, while the pilot ejects from the plane.
He then fights Gabriel inside a warehouse. McClane is shot and he loses his gun. Gabriel puts him in an arm lock and orders his man to shoot Lucy. McClane presses the gun into his shoulder and fires, injuring himself but killing Gabriel. Farrell wildly fires his gun to kill the man that is holding Lucy. The movie ends with the FBI swarming the area and taking Farrell and McClane to the hospital.

Die Hard with a Vengeance

Die Hard with a Vengeance is a 1995 American action movie starring Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson. It is the third movie in the "Die Hard" series.
Simon Gruber is the older brother of the villain from the first movie, Hans Gruber. Simon destroys a building in New York City. He says that he will destroy another one unless the police do what he tells them to do. His first task is to have John McClane to go Harlem and stand around for 15 minutes with a sign that says "I hate niggers" with his gun taped to his back so that he cannot reach it. A group of black men attack McClane. A shopkeeper named Zeus Carver saves McClane by grabbing the gun and getting into a taxicab.
The next task that Gruber has them do is to reach a pay phone. He then gives them a riddle and has them call back within 30 seconds to the right phone number (the answer to the riddle is the last four digits) or else the trash can full of explosives will be detonated. They call back with the right phone number but it is past 30 seconds. Carver and McClane duck out of the way as Gruber laughs.
The third task that Gruber sets for them is to reach the Wall Street subway station by 10:20 a.m. or else the station will be blown up. McClane and Carver steal a taxicab and cut through the park to reach the station in time. McClane stops at an earlier station and gets on the train. He then searches the train for the bomb and finds it. He throws it out of the cab car. Carver gets to the Wall Street station and picks up the phone, but because McClane is not there, Gruber says they did not follow his rules. The train rolls over the detonator and sets it off. The bomb explodes and destroys a large part of the station. McClane is injured but is alive.
The FBI come in and tell him that the man's name is Simon Gruber and that he is Hans' brother. Simon calls in again and tells him that he has placed a bomb inside one of the schools in New York City. Any attempt to get the children out will result in the bomb being blown up. He tells McClane and Carver to head to a park. The entire police force goes out and starts to search every school to find the bomb.
With the police gone, Simon Gruber and a bunch of dump trucks come in. They kill the security guards and begin to steal the gold from the vault in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. McClane and Carver arrive at the park and find another bomb. They use a five-gallon and three-gallon jug to make four gallons and put it on the weight to disable it. McClane catches a kid stealing something; the kid says that there's not a cop for miles around. McClane then goes to the Federal Reserve building and walks in. As Gruber's men escort him down, he asks them about lotto numbers and realizes that they are not the real cops and kills them.
McClane then drives a car out to intercept Gruber and his men. He has Carver go out to Yankee Stadium since that's what Gruber originally told them to do. Gruber drives into a aqueduct. McClane follows them in, but they flood it, causing a ton of water to rush out. McClane grabs a ladder and is sent flying into the air. Meanwhile, Carver went to Yankee Stadium and did not find anybody. Two of Gruber's men with sniper rifles are there to kill him, but decide to follow Carver instead since McClane is not with him. Carver is driving on a highway and sees McClane as he is thrown into the air. A car chase and gunfight take place as Gruber's men show up to try to kill them.
McClane and Carver find Gruber loading the gold onto a cargo boat in New York Harbor. After getting in, a few battles take place and Carver and McClane are captured by Gruber's men. They are then tied up and Gruber sets the fuse to blow the boat up. Before leaving, Gruber tosses McClane a bottle of aspirin. Gruber claims he is blowing up $100 billion of gold bullion but there is nothing inside; he is trying to make the value of gold higher by "destroying" the supply. McClane and Carver work their way out of the cuffs and jump to safety as the ship blows up.
They are rescued by the police. On the ship, McClane takes a quarter to call his wife. As he is being connected, he takes an aspirin, looks at the bottom, and realizes that Gruber is heading to Canada. They intercept him and fly a helicopter over his ship. In the ensuring fight, Gruber gets in his own helicopter and shoots and hits their helicopter, forcing them to land. McClane starts running to make Gruber shoot at him. He notices a bunch of power lines and shoots them. The lines fall on Gruber's helicopter and kill him.

Die Hard 2

Die Hard 2 (also called Die Hard 2: Die Harder) is an American action movie starring Bruce Willis, Bonnie Bedelia, and William Sadler. It was released on the Fourth of July weekend in 1990.
This movie begins on Christmas Eve 1990. John McClane is at the Washington Dulles International Airport, waiting for his wife Holly's plane to land, and his car gets towed away. He argues with the airport security for a little bit before going inside. There, he sees a couple of men handing off a package to each other and does not like it. He goes to tell the airport police, but stops because the same man who towed his car is there. Instead, McClane enters the baggage area, where one of the men pulls a Glock gun and starts firing. During the gun fight, one man, named Oswald Cochrane, is killed when he goes through a baggage sorting machine. The other man manages to escape.
McClane tells the chief head of police, a man named Carmine Lorenzo, but Lorenzo thinks that these men are only "punks stealing luggage." McClane goes out there and gets fingerprints from the dead man. He faxes them to his friend Al Powell in Los Angeles, telling Powell to run the fingerprints through police records to find out who this person is. Powell does so and then gives McClane the man's record. The record says that Cochrane died two years ago in 1988 but is somehow still alive today. McClane believes he is a professional mercenary.
McClane goes to up to the airport tower and tells them that someone is about to "fuck with the airport." He says that he does not know what they will do. Lorenzo forces him out.
A man named Colonel Stuart then puts his plan into action. He cuts off all electronics inside the airport tower and takes control of all their items – the instrument that lands the planes and all radios. He then says that, in a couple of hours, a cargo plane will be landing. The plane has a man named Ramon Esperanza. Esperanza is the drug lord of the fictional country of Val Verde. The United States Justice Department is going to put him in jail. Stuart tells them that he wants a fully-fueled Boeing 747 to be put on the runway and says that nobody should touch the Esperanza's plane or try to restore the landing instruments.
McClane finds a janitor named Marvin. McClane has Marvin tell him where to go. Just before McClane was forced out, he heard that the air traffic controllers wanted to head to the Annex Skywalk, a new branch of the airport, to restore their systems. Lorenzo sends his SWAT team and the communications director, Leslie Barnes, to head to the Skywalk. As McClane expected, Stuart's men attack the SWAT team. They kill all five members and are about to kill Barnes when McClane comes through a vent shaft and kills them all. 
Moments later, the antenna outpost explodes. It was a trap. Stuart then calls in to tell them that it was stupid to try to restore their systems. He then picks a flight that is low on fuel. He resets the ground level of the landing system to be 200 feet below, so that when the plane is at 200 feet they think they are at 400 feet. He then crashes the plane into the ground, killing all of the passengers on board.
Afterwards, a Special Forces unit from the United States Army comes in, led by Major Grant. They take a meeting in the pilot's briefing room. McClane gets Marvin to try to tell him where the room is. During the search, McClane finds a two-way radio that one of Stuart's men dropped. He listens in and finds out that Esperanza has taken over the plane and shot the two pilots. The plane is out of control and he needs to land right away. Stuart tells him to land on the nearest runway. 
McClane gets out there first and punches him before Stuart's men show up. They trap him in the cockpit and throw grenades. McClane escapes by strapping up in the pilot's ejection seat and blasting off as the grenades explode.
Barnes listens to McClane's story. Because Stuart's men showed up so fast, Barnes thinks that they must be close by. They find the church where they are basing their operations and send in the Army Special Forces out there to fight. During the gun battle, McClane sees that Stuart's men are escaping on snowmobiles. He shoots one guy with a gun that he stole, takes his mobile, and chases after them. However his gun does not work and his mobile gets shot and he falls down. He opens his gun and finds that there were rubber bullets in there. He realizes that Stuart and the special forces are working together.
McClane comes back to the airport. He says that they are working together. Lorezno does not believe him until McClane fires the gun to show that they are rubber bullets. Meanwhile, the people at the airport are panicked. A reporter named Richard Thornberg has broadcast that terrorists have taken over the airport. As a result, Lorenzo and McClane cannot get out there fast enough.
Instead, McClane gets a ride with Samantha Coleman and her news helicopter. The 747 has already left the hanger. McClane gets the pilot to drop him over the wing of the 747. Esperanza, who is flying the plane, sees McClane. Grant goes out there fights but is sucked into the engine of the plane. McClane finds the fuel hatch. When Stuart kicks McClane off the plane, McClane manages to open it and the plane starts losing fuel. McClane then takes his cigarette lighter and ignites the fuel and the plane blows up.
The fire trail of the plane allows the planes flying overhead to see the ground. Holly lands safely and the two of them come back together. The movie ends with Marvin driving them off.

Die Hard

Die Hard is a 1988 American action movie starring Bruce Willis. It is the first movie in a series, and was followed by "Die Hard 2".
The movie is set on Christmas Eve at the Nakatomi building in Los Angeles, California. John McClane (Bruce Willis) is flying in from New York to meet his wife Holly during the Nakatomi’s annual Christmas party. While there, they get into an argument over Holly's choice to use her maiden name instead of her married name. Shortly afterwards, a group of German terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) invade the building and take all the people hostages. They want the bearer bonds in the building ' s vault and ask the CEO, Joseph Takgai, for the access code to the first barrier. When he says no, Gruber shoots and kills him.
McClane witnesses Gruber killing Takagi and tries to get help. He pulls a fire alarm, but the terrorists find out and reverse the alarm. Gruber then sends a man named Tony to find whoever pulled the alarm. In the ensuring battle, McClane snaps Tony's neck and takes his machine gun. He then puts the dead man in an elevator and pushes buttons so that it stops on the floor where the partygoers are being held. Upon finding Tony, Gruber sends more men to find him. After killing two more of Gruber's men, McClane finds and takes some detonators.
On the rooftop, McClane radios for help. The dispatchers send a patrol car in. Just as the police officer is about to leave, McClane drops the body of a dead terrorist on his patrol car. The LAPD arrive. They send in a tank and four SWAT team members, but Gruber's men beat back both attacks. When Gruber ignores McClane's request to stop attacking, McClane takes some C4 explosives and blows up part of the building.
Holly's co-worker Harry then tries to talk to the terrorists. He tries to get McClane to give up the detonators, but when he refuses, Gruber shoots and kills Harry. Shortly afterwards, McClane finds Gruber, who was trying to check the explosives. Gruber fakes an American accent, throwing McClane off. As they talk, Gruber's men show up and shoot out the glass. McClane injures his feet severely as he tries to walk across the floor and loses the detonators in the process.
The FBI arrives and orders the building's power to be cut. Gruber informs the FBI that he wants two helicopters and he will escort the hostages to the top of the building. The power outage opens up the final locks on the building's vault, where Gruber scoops up the bonds. The FBI plans to send gunships to kill the terrorists, but Gruber had lined the top of the building with explosives and plans to blow it up to cover his escape.
A reporter named Richard Thornberg manages to interview McClane's children. Gruber, seeing this on TV, realizes that Holly is McClane's wife and takes her hostage. McClane finds the explosives and realizes what Gruber is up to. However, Gruber's man Karl finds him and they engage in a vicious hand-to-hand combat. McClane leaves Karl for dead and rushes up to the top of the building. He and forces the hostages to go back down into the building. The FBI fires at him. Gruber blows up the top of the building. McClane ties a fire hose around his waist and jumps off the building.
McClane finally meets Gruber one last time. He tricks him by throwing his gun down and then using another gun to shoot Gruber. Gruber falls out of the building, nearly taking Holly with him. McClane unties her watch and Gruber falls to his death. Afterwards, they go home in a limo.

Pikmin (series)

"Pikmin" is set on a world that is supposed to be Earth, but Captain Olimar is very tiny, so it looks like a strange world to the player. The first level of "Pikmin" looks like Shigeru Miyamoto's backyard. Nintendo made it seem more like Earth by adding common items, like a globe of the Earth, a Duracell battery, and a Pepsi bottle cap.
Both games use real-time strategy gameplay. The player plays as Captain Olimar, who can command his Pikmin. Olimar gets Pikmin by bringing pellets, a type of food, and bad guys to an Onion, which is the Pikmin's ship. Pikmin will come out of the Onion and get planted in the ground so that Olimar can pull them out. Olimar can use Pikmin to take stuff back to his base, fight insects and other creatures, or travel across places.
"Pikmin" is the first game in the series and came out in 2001 on the Nintendo GameCube. Captain Olimar crashlands on an alien planet, and unites with a creature called Pikmin. He only has 30 days life support, and so he and the Pikmin try to find the pieces of his ship that broke off so he can escape.
"Pikmin 2" came out in 2004 for the Nintendo GameCube. It uses the same gameplay, but adds a new character called Louie, two new kinds of Pikmin, and a new type of area called Underground, where Olimar and Louie search for treasure in. It also added multiplayer, where one player can be Olimar and another can be Louie.
A new "Pikmin" game will come out in the future, but has no name or console yet. It was announced at Nintendo's developer roundtable at E3.
"Pikmin" has appeared in the "Super Smash Bros." series. In "Super Smash Bros. Melee", "Pikmin" has a couple of collectibles of Captain Olimar and the Pikmin. In "Super Smash Bros. Brawl", Captain Olimar is a playable character along with his Pikmin. Music, enemies, and an area are also taken from the series for stuff in "Brawl".

The red-necked wallaby ("Macropus rufogriseus") is a medium-sized macropod, common in parts of eastern Australia. As one of the largest wallabies, it looks like a kangaroo. Males can weigh more than 20 kg and have a head-body length of 90 cm.
Red-necked wallabies have a black nose and paws, white stripe on the upper lip, and a medium grey coat with a red color on their neck.
Red-necked wallabies are found along the coast and forests of eastern Australia, from Rockhampton, Queensland to the South Australian border; in Tasmania and on many of the Bass Strait islands (many of these may have been introduced to the islands).
In Tasmania, north-east New South Wales and coastal Queensland, their numbers have got bigger over the past 30 years. This is because they are no longer hunted. A lot of forest has been cleared for grass where wallabies can feed at night, alongside trees where they can shelter by day. It is less common in Victoria.
Like most macropods, the red-necked wallaby lives by itself. Groups, also called mobs, share feeding areas. They feed at night and in the late afternoon, generally eating grass and herbs close to forest shelter.
There are two subspecies. The Tasmanian form, "Macropus rufogriseus rufogriseus", also called Bennett's wallaby is smaller, has longer fur, and breeds in the late summer, mostly between February and April. They can live close to people and are seen feeding on lawns in the suburbs of Hobart and other towns.
The mainland form, "Macropus rufogriseus banksianus", breeds all year round. A female can have babies at the about 14 months old. A baby red-necked wallaby, called a joey, lives in the mothers pouch for 9 months, and continues to feed from the mother till about 12–15 months of age.

Battle of Baghdad (1258)

The Battle of Baghdad in 1258 was a victory for the Mongol leader Hulagu Khan, a grandson of Genghis Khan. Baghdad was captured, sacked, and over time burned.
Baghdad was the capital of the Abbasid Empire. This was an Islamic empire in what is now Iraq. The Abbasid caliphs were the second of the Islamic dynasties.
The Mongol army, led by Hulagu (also spelled as Hulegu) Khan and the Chinese commander Guo Kan in vice-command, set out for Baghdad in November of 1257. Hulagu marched with what was probably the largest army ever fielded by the Mongols. By order of Mongke Khan, one in ten fighting men in the entire empire were gathered for Hulagu's army (Saunders 1971). The attacking army also had a large contingent of Christian forces.
Hulagu demanded surrender; the caliph refused. Many accounts say that the caliph failed to prepare for the fight; he neither gathered armies nor strengthened the walls of Baghdad.
Hulagu divided his forces, so that they threatened both sides of the city, on the east and west banks of the Tigris. The attacking Mongols broke some dikes and flooded the ground behind the caliph’s army, trapping them. Much of the army was slaughtered or drowned.
Under Guo Kan's order, the Chinese counterparts in the Mongolian army then laid siege to the city, constructing a palisade and ditch, wheeling up siege engines and catapults. The siege started on January 29. The battle was swift, by siege standards. By February 5 the Mongols controlled a stretch of the wall. Al-Musta'sim tried to negotiate, but was refused.
On February 10 Baghdad surrendered. The Mongols swept into the city on February 13 and began a week of massacre, looting, rape, and destruction.

J. D. Salinger

Jerome David Salinger (January 1, 1919 – January 27, 2010), better known as J. D. Salinger, was an American writer. He was best known for his 1951 novel "The Catcher in the Rye".
Salinger was born Jerome David Salinger in Manhattan, New York on January 1, 1919.
Salinger began writing short stories while in secondary school. In 1936, he went to work in Austria, but left 2 years later, just before Germany took Austria over. 
Salinger published several stories in the early 1940s before serving in World War II. In 1948 he published the story "A Perfect Day for Bananafish" in "The New Yorker" magazine, which also published most of his following work. 
In 1951, his first novel "The Catcher in the Rye" was published. It became an immediate popular success. 
On January 27, 2010, Salinger died in his home in Cornish, New Hampshire of natural causes at age 91.
Salinger did not like publicity: He never published an original work after 1965 and was never interviewed after 1980. In fact, he told his agent to burn any mail that fans sent him. He also did not want his photograph on the jacket of his books.
On November 28, 2013, scans of three unpublished Salinger stories were uploaded to the Internet. It was done by a user of What.CD, an invite-only BitTorrent tracker site. The file was quickly removed by administrators of the site. It is not currently clear how the unpublished material was uploaded, as the original gangster sources came from two different locations (the University of Texas and Princeton). This shows that the works may have been obtained on separate occasions and then put together. Salinger's unpublished works quickly spread over to open BitTorrent sites like The Pirate Bay and image-sharing sites such as Imgur.
Despite What.CD's quick response, Salinger's unpublished writings will forever be available on the internet.

John Glenn

John Herschel Glenn Jr. (born July 18, 1921) is a former astronaut and United States Senator. He is best known for being the first American to orbit the Earth as an astronaut for NASA. After becoming famous as an astronaut he went into politics and served as a Senator from his home state of Ohio from 1974-1999. In 1998, he made his second spaceflight at the age of 77 years. He is the oldest man ever in outer space. After the death of senator Edward Brooke in January 2015, he became the oldest living former U.S. senator.
John Glenn was born in Cambridge, Ohio, to John Glenn, Sr. and Teresa (née Sproat). He was raised in New Concord, Ohio. Glenn studied Engineering at Muskingum College, and received his private pilot's license for physics course credit in 1941. He received a bachelor of science at Muskingum College in 1942.
Glenn joined the United States Navy in 1942 and became a pilot. He switched to the United States Marine Corps shortly afterwards. He served as a pilot in World War II and flew missions over the Pacific Ocean.
Glenn stayed in the Marines after the war and again saw combat in the Korean War, where he shot down three enemy planes and flew in 63 combat missions. On July 16, 1957, then-Major Glenn set the Transcontinental air speed record, flying a F8U-1 Crusader from NAS Los Alamitos to Floyd Bennett Field, Brooklyn, in 3 hours, 23 minutes, and 8.4 seconds.
Project Bullet, as the mission was called, provided both the first transcontinental flight to average supersonic speed, and the first continuous transcontinental panoramic photograph of the United States. Glenn was awarded his fifth Distinguished Flying Cross for the mission.
In 1958 he joined Project Mercury. He was the oldest of the seven pilots selected. Although Alan Shepard and Gus Grissom flew in outer space before Glenn did, Glenn was the first American to orbit the earth, as neither of the previous two had made a full orbit. He flew a Mercury spacecraft called Friendship 7. His first words when reaching orbit were "Zero G and I feel fine." After successfully finishing his flight he became a hero in the US. He retired from NASA and the military after his flight.
He went into business and was an executive for Royal Crown Cola. Glenn was friends with Robert F. Kennedy, and Kennedy, an Attorney General and US Senator, told Glenn he should run for office. He planned on running for Senate in 1964, but an accident at home led him to decide not to. In 1974 he did run for Senate as a Democrat, defeating Senator Howard Metzenbaum in the primary. Glenn went on to beat Ralph J. Perk in the general election. He was reelected to the Senate in 1980. In 1984 he ran for President but the Democratic nomination went to Walter Mondale, who lost to Ronald Reagan in the general election. Glenn was a popular senator and was reelected several more times. In 1998 he returned to space, flying on the Space Shuttle "Discovery". He is the oldest person to fly in space and the only sitting US Senator to fly in space. He retired from the Senate in 1999. He helped set up the John Glenn School of Public affairs at Ohio State University. He was given the metal of Freedom in 2012 by President Barack Obama
On April 6, 1943, Glenn married his childhood sweetheart, Anna Margaret Castor. They had met in New Concord and played together in the school band. They are the parents of two children. Glenn lives in Columbus, Ohio with his wife.

<doc id="120176" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=120176" title="Sahelanthropus">
Sahelanthropus

Sahelanthropus tchadensis is a fossil hominid. From evidence at the fossil site in Chad in the African Sahel, it is thought to have lived about 7 million years ago. 
The split of the line into humans and chimpanzees (known as "human-chimpanzee divergence") probably happened between 6.3 and 5.4 million years ago. This can be seen from genetic data. Because the fossil is older than this spilt, its status is unclear. The first fossil found is known as "Toumaï" today.
Some fossils, a cranium (skull), five pieces of jaw, and some teeth, make up a head that has features that are like both modern and primitive humans. The braincase is only 340 cm³ to 360 cm³ in volume, about the same as chimpanzees. It is much less than the human volume of about 1350 cm³.
The teeth and structure of the face are very different from Homo sapiens. The cranium found is damaged, it is very distorted, so no 3D computer reconstruction has been made. There are no bones other than parts of the skull. It is unknown if "Sahelanthropus tchadensis" was bipedal (walked on two legs). The placement of the foramen magnum suggests they were, though. Its canine wear is similar to other Miocene apes.
"Sahelanthropus" may be an ancestor of both humans and chimpanzees; no consensus has been reached yet by the scientific community. The difficulty is caused by its "mosaic of primitive and derived features". Probably it lived in semi-open woodland and savannah, rather than the rainforest of present-day apes.
Another possibility is that Toumaï is related to both humans and chimpanzees, but is the ancestor of neither. Brigitte Senut and Martin Pickford, the discoverers of "Orrorin tugenensis", suggested that the features of "S. tchadensis" are consistent with a female proto-gorilla. Even if this claim is upheld, the find would still be significant, for at present few chimpanzee or gorilla ancestors have been found anywhere in Africa. Thus, if "S. tchadensis" is an ancestral relative of the chimpanzees (or gorillas), it represents the first known member of "their" lineage. 
Furthermore, "S. tchadensis" does indicate that the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees is unlikely to resemble chimpanzees very much, as had been previously supposed by some paleontologists.
The fauna found at the site suggest an age of more than 6 million years, as these species were probably extinct already by that time.
One study has suggested a much earlier split between the line which led to modern apes, and the line which led to modern humans.
The complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecule of the baboon "Papio hamadryas" was sequenced and included in a molecular analysis of 24 complete mammalian mtDNAs. The aim of the study was to time the divergence between the Old World monkeys (Cercopithidae) and the Hominoidea. That divergence, at 30 million years ago (mya), was a reference point for the split between chimpanzee, and "Homo" at 5 mya. 
In the later study by Arnason and colleagues, two independent nonprimate molecular references were used. These two references suggested that the Cercopithecoidea/Hominoidea divergence took place >50 mya. Also, all hominoid divergences receive a much earlier dating. Thus the estimated date of the divergence between "Pan" (chimpanzee) and "Homo" is 1013 mya and that between "Gorilla" and the "Pan"/"Homo" linage approximately 17 mya. The same datings were obtained in an analysis of clocklike evolving genes.

Australopithecine

The term Australopithecine ('australos' for short) refers to any species in the related genera "Australopithecus" or "Paranthropus". These genera occurred in the Pliocene–Pleistocene era, and were bipedal. The arrangement of their teeth, especially the dental arcade, was similar to humans. They did not have the large canine teeth characteristic of present-day apes.
They had a brain size not much larger than modern apes, lacking the large brain of the genus "Homo". They were mainly bipedal, but probably capable of climbing and living at least partly in trees. Their arms were longer in proportion to their bodies, and this also suggests their inherited capacity to move above the ground. The efficiency of their walking is difficult to estimate, but they were not so well adapted to bipedalism as humans. The males were much larger than the females, which suggests a family arrangement with a dominant male and several females, as with modern apes. Nothing is known for certain about their use of tools.
They are in the hominins,and appeared in the late Miocene.
When used alone, the term refers to both genera together. "Australopithecus" is sometimes referred to as the "gracile (slender) australopithecines", while "Paranthropus" are also called the "robust australopithecines".
Other genera:
A likely ancestor of the australopithecines is the "Ardipithecus" genus, which lived in East Africa. The genus "Homo" (humans), appears about 2.4 million years ago with "Homo habilis". Australos moved into mixed savannah/woodland habitats as the climate cooled in the later Miocene. This explains their adaptations to walking or walking plus climbing. It also explains the changes to their diet and teeth, though not in detail. The great increase in brain size of modern man began with the genus "Homo": it did not start with the australos.
The australopithecines according to Briggs & Crowther.

Sahara pump theory

The Sahara Pump Theory attempts to explain how plants and animals from Africa moved into the Middle East and then Europe and Asia. 
At the time, Africa was rainier than it is today, and the Sahara was wetter, with bigger lakes and more rivers. 
African rainy periods are associated with a "wet Sahara" phase, during which larger lakes and more rivers exist. This causes changes in the type of animals found in the area. 
Regardless of the aridity of the greater Sahara, migration along the river corridor was halted when, during a desert phase 1.8-0.8 million years ago, the Nile ceased to flow completely and possibly flowed only temporarily in other periods due to Nubian Swell uplift.
During the periods of a wet Sahara, the Sahara and Arabia become a savanna grassland and African flora and fauna become common. During the following dry period, the Sahara reverts to desert conditions usually as a result of the retreat of the West African Monsoon southwards. Evaporation exceeds precipitation, the level of water in lakes like Lake Chad falls, and rivers become dry wadis. 
Flora and fauna previously widespread retreat northwards to the Atlas Mountains, southwards into West Africa, or eastwards into the Nile Valley and thence either south-east to the Ethiopian Highlands and Kenya or north-east across the Sinai into Asia. This separates populations of some of the species in areas with different climates, forcing them to adapt, possibly giving rise to speciation (species splitting).
The Saharan pump has been used to date four waves of human emigration from Africa, namely:

Originally and often still a form of independent music, it is closely associated with indie rock, both genres are similar, yet there are differences between both. Indie rock tends to be edgier, rougher and harsher-sounding, contrasting the more melodious indie pop. Indie pop additionally takes influences from 1960s girl group music and power pop, often giving it retro elements, and makes usage of jangly guitars.
In 1986, British music magazine "NME" released a cassette called "C86", which included indie pop and indie rock music; the artists in "C86" made music which was described by About.com as "a twee, amateurish form of home-made music drawing deeply from sunny '60s acts like The Byrds and the Velvet Underground."
Early indie pop bands include The Shop Assistants or The Pastels. More recent bands in the genre include Point blank, Travis, The Research and Maritime.

Stuttering

Stuttering or Stammering is a problem some people have when they speak. 5-6% of children have a stammer while 1% of adults have a stammer. Men are 4 times more likely to have a stammer than women. Stammers normally start at 2-6 years and run in families. The person knows what they want to say but the flow of their speech is ‘bumpy’ and may have some of the following features:
Stammering can be very upsetting and knock a person's confidence. Joseph Sheehan compared stuttering to an iceberg, with the bumpy parts you can hear (overt parts) of stuttering above the waterline, and the larger block of how the person feels (covert parts) invisible below the surface. These people may feel embarrassment, shame, frustration, fear, anger, and guilt These feelings may increase stress and effort making the person stammer more. Such negative feelings may be an important part of a treatment program.
Stammers affect peoples lives as they may not have the confidence to apply for job interviews or make friends.
Stuttering therapy
This therapy is also known as "speak more fluently", "prolonged speech" or "connected speech." It trains stutterers to speak fluently (without the ‘bumpy bits’) by controlling their breathing and how they move their lips, jaw, and tongue.
Stutterers are trained to slow down their speaking rate by stretching vowels and consonants. Other methods include soft speech contacts. This helps to make very slow but non bumpy speech used only in the speech clinic. To make more normal sounding speech for daily life speed of speech is increased. Many people find their speech does not sound natural at the end of therapy. Fluency shaping approaches are normally taught in groups therapy programs, which may take two to three weeks to complete. More recently the Camperdown program, using a much shorter schedule, has been shown to work well.
The goal of stuttering modification therapy is not to get rid of stuttering but to change it so that stuttering is easier and less stressful. As fear and worry make people stutter by getting rid of these feelings stuttering will decrease. The most widely known approach was made by Charles Van Riper in 1973 and is also known as block modification therapy. Stuttering modification therapy has four stages: 
There were many famous "stutterers":

Life expectancy

Life expectancy is how long a person is expected to live. It is based on many factors such as country and life style including smoking, diet, and exercise.
There are great changes in life expectancy between different parts of the world, mostly caused by differences in public health, medical care and diet. Much of the excess mortality (higher death rates) in poorer nations is due to war, not enough food, and medical conditions or diseases (AIDS, Malaria, etc.). 
Over the past 200 years, countries with black or African populations have generally not had the same improvements in mortality rates that have been enjoyed by other peoples. Even in countries with a majority of white people, such as USA, Britain, Ireland and France, black people tend to have shorter life expectancies than their white counterparts (although the statistics are often not analysed by race). For example, in the U.S. white Americans are expected to live until age 78, but African Americans only until age 71.
Climate may also have an effect, and the way data is collected may also influence the figures. According to the CIA World Factbook, Macau has the world's longest life expectancy of 84.4 years.
There are also significant differences in life expectancy between men and women in most countries, with women typically outliving men by around five years. Economic circumstances also affect life expectancy. For example, in the United Kingdom, life expectancy in the expensive areas like Kensington is several years longer than in the poorest areas such as Glasgow. This may reflect factors such as diet and lifestyle as well as access to medical care. It may also reflect a selective effect: people with chronic life-threatening illnesses are less likely to become wealthy or to live in expensive areas.

Demosthenes

Demosthenes (384–322 BC, Greek: Δημοσθένης, Dēmosthénēs) was a well-known Greek statesman and orator from ancient Athens. His speeches show the height of classical Athenian skill at speaking. They also show us lots about the politics and culture of ancient Greece during the 4th century BC. Demosthenes learned rhetoric by studying the speeches of previous great orators. He delivered his first law court speeches when he was twenty. He argued effectively to gain from his guardians what was left of his inheritance. For a time, Demosthenes made his living as a professional speech-writer and a lawyer, writing speeches for use in private legal suits. 
At the age of 21, Demosthenes took the job of the commander of warships in Athens.
Demosthenes grew interested in politics during the time he wrote speeches for others. In 354 BC he gave his first public political speeches. He went on to devote his most productive years to opposing Macedon's expansion. He idealized his city and tried throughout his life to restore Athens' supremacy and motivate the rest of the Athenians against Philip II of Macedon. He sought to preserve his city's freedom and to establish an alliance against Macedon, in an unsuccessful attempt to impede Philip's plans to expand his influence southwards by conquering all the Greek states. After Philip's death, Demosthenes played a leading part in his city's uprising against the new King of Macedon, Alexander the Great. However, his efforts failed and the revolt was met with a harsh Macedonian reaction. To prevent a similar revolt against his own rule, Alexander's successor, Antipater, sent his men to track Demosthenes down. Demosthenes took his own life, in order to avoid being arrested by Archias, Antipater's confidant.
The "Alexandrian Canon" compiled by Aristophanes of Byzantium and Aristarchus of Samothrace recognized Demosthenes as one of the ten greatest Attic orators and speech writers. According to Longinus, Demosthenes "perfected to the utmost the tone of lofty speech, living passions, copiousness, readiness, speed". Cicero acclaimed him as "the perfect orator" who lacked nothing, and Quintilian extolled him as "lex orandi" ("the standard of oratory") and that "inter omnes unus excellat" ("he stands alone among all the orators").

A joystick is an input device consisting of a stick that pivots on a base and reports its angle or direction to the device it is controlling. Joysticks are often used to control video games, and usually have one or more push-buttons whose state can also be read by the computer. A popular variation of the joystick used on modern video game consoles is the analog stick.
The joystick has been the principal flight control in the cockpit of many aircraft, particularly military fast jets, where centre stick or side-stick location may be employed.
Joysticks are also used for controlling machines such as cranes, trucks, underwater unmanned vehicles and zero turning radius lawn mowers. Miniature finger-operated joysticks have been adopted as input devices for smaller electronic equipment such as mobile phones.

Animal Crossing, known as in Japan, is a life simulation video game made by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 and Nintendo GameCube game consoles. It was only released on the Nintendo 64 in Japan in 2001. In 2002, it was released in North America, Europe and Australia for the Nintendo GameCube. 
It supports the GameCube-Game Boy Advance link cable and the e-Reader items and has emulated Nintendo Entertainment System games in it as items. That means that the player can replay old NES games within the game itself.
In Animal Crossing the player moves into a village where everyone is an animal. Only the player is human. 1-4 people can move to the village and live in their own house. They have to pay money (called "bells") for the house, and when they did it the house will get bigger. Bells can be earned by fishing, catching insects, selling things and other ways. The players can buy the things they like from Tom Nook (a racoon who has got a shop in the village) and put them in their houses. If their house looks nice, they get points and things from the HRA (Happy Room Academy). They also can buy clothes. The game is played in real time and has no ending. You can visit the villages of other players by using their Memory Card.
The animals are different. There are different kinds of animals (for example cats, mice or dogs) and different characters (for example lazy, active...)
Tom Nook is a racoon who has got a shop called "Nook's Cranny" where you can buy things for your house or clothes. If you buy many things it gets bigger. You work there at the beginning of the game to pay for your house.
Mable and Sable are two hedgehogs who have a shop called "Able Sisters" where players can make their own clothes.
Tortimer is an old turtle who is the mayor of the village in Animal Crossing:Population Growing, Animal Crossing: Wild World, and Animal Crossing: City Folk (Known in EU as: Let's go to the City!) In Animal Crossing: New Leaf, you are the mayor.
Pelly and Phyllis are two pelicans who work at the post. You can send letters to the villagers.
Resetti is an angry mole. He comes when you reset the game and don't save it.
K.K. Slider is a dog who comes to the train station every Saturday evening at 8.00 pm. He sings songs. You can take them to your house and listen to them there.
At some days there are special things in Animal Crossing, some of them like days in real life, for example Christmas, Halloween or Thanksgiving. Some are special events which are only in the game like fishing competitions. Sometimes you can get special items at days like that, for example Christmas clothes and furniture.
There are nineteen NES games in Animal Crossing: Balloon Fight, Baseball, Clu Clu Land, Clu Clu Land D, Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong 3, Donkey Kong Jr., Donkey Kong Jr. Math, Excitebike, Golf, Pinball, Punch-Out!!, Soccer, Tennis, Wario's Woods; Ice Climber and Mario Bros. (only with e-Reader); Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda (only with hacking). They work just like the original games.

Scranton, Pennsylvania

Scranton is a city in Pennsylvania. It is the county seat of Lackawanna County. The city had a population of 76,415 people in 2000. 
Scranton was first settled in 1776 by Lenape Indians. Over time, settlers from New England began to move to Scranton. They built mills and other small businesses. The village was known as Slocum Hollow. In 1845, Scranton started to manufacture iron and steel. The iron was used for making rails. Scranton became a leading maker of iron rails. A railroad was founded in 1851. It was built to move iron and coal. 
Scranton became a borough in 1856. In 1866, Scranton was made a city when Hyde Park and Providence joined together with the Borough of Scranton. The city had 35,000 people living in it. In 1866, a streetcar system was built. It was the first in the United States. Scranton got the nickname "The Electric City" because of this. In the late 1890s, Scranton had several minor league baseball teams.
The United States Census said that Scranton had a population of 102,026 people in the year 1900. This made it the 38th largest city in the United States. In the 1900s, Scranton was known for its many Victorian-style houses.
In 1901, the iron industry in Scranton moved to Lackawanna, New York. Scranton lost one of its main industries. In the next 25 years, many people from Eastern Europe moved to Scranton. Two years later, the Laurel Line railroad opened up, making it easy to go to Wilkes-Barre, 20 miles South. After World War II, coal began losing cleaner fuels such as oil and gas. This caused Scranton to diminish. There wasn't as much coal being made, and not as many trains passed through. The streetcar system stopped in 1954, and a year later, the city was flooded after Hurricane Diane. 80 people died. The NYO&W freight railroad stopped going to Scranton in 1957.
The Knox Mine Disaster of 1959 wiped out the mining industry as the Susquehanna River flooded most of the mines in Northeastern Pennsylvania. The local DL&W railroad, nearly out of money, merged with the Erie Railroad in 1960. In the 1960s and 1970s, the silk and textile industries was getting smaller as they moved South or overseas. In the 1970s and 1980s, the downtown shops lay empty as it was best to shop in suburban malls. However, in the 1980s, the people of Scranton started revitalizing the city. Old places were marketed as tourist attractions. There is a historic site commemorating the city's railroad history, a hotel at the former DL&W Railroad station and a trolley museum. Some more modern attractions are a ski resort, the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees (a minor league baseball team) and a concert venue. Also, popular sitcom The Office is set in Scranton.

Necronomicon

The Necronomicon is a fictional book of magic created by the horror writer H. P. Lovecraft. It is a Greek-sounding word commonly translated as "book of dead names". It is pronounced "neck-ro-nom-ih-kon". Like most of his ideas, the "Necronomicon" came to Lovecraft in his dreams. Lovecraft let his friends write stories about the "Necronomicon". Eventually, fake "Necronomicon"s were written.
According to Lovecraft, the "Necronomicon" was written in the eighth century by a crazy Arabian man named Abdul Alhazred. Alhazred (who was also fictional) practiced evil magic. He assembled a collection of evil spells into a manuscript (a book with loose pages and no cover) which he called "Al Azif". Lovecraft said this as an Arabian phrase for a scary sound, like a scream. Later, the original manuscript was translated into Greek. It was given the title "Necronomicon". Olaus Wormius (a real person) then translated the Greek version into Latin. John Dee (also real) translated the "Necronomicon" into English. Lovecraft liked to mix in real people and places in his fiction. This made the stories seem more real. Some people were fooled into thinking what he wrote was true.
Since Lovecraft's death, several authors have written their own versions of the "Necronomicon". They are the author's imagination of what the "Necronomicon" would be like, if it were real. A few claim to be the actual "Necronomicon". The most famous case of a "real" "Necronomicon" is the "Simon" "Necronomicon". Simon is a fake name. It was published in the 1970s. The "Simon" "Necronomicon" is based on Sumerian mythology. It has nothing to do with H. P. Lovecraft's fiction. Some people dislike the "Simon" "Necronomicon". They do not like that it pretends to be real. Sometimes, people believe it to be real. Simon has written several books about the "Necronomicon"'s "discovery". 
Here are some hoax Necronomicons (books that the authors claim are the real Necronomicon):

Occult

Occult refers to an area of knowledge or thought that is hidden. The word occult has many uses in the English language. Often it means knowledge that lies outside the range of normal experience or scientific explanation. The term sometimes means knowledge meant only for certain people or knowledge that must be kept hidden. For most occultists it is the study of a deeper spiritual reality.
The term occult is also used as a label given to a number of magical organizations or orders, and the teachings and practices as taught by them. The name also extends to a large body of literature and spiritual philosophy.
Occultism is the study of occult. It can involve such subjects as magic (alternatively spelled and defined as magick), extra-sensory perception, astrology, spiritualism, numerology and lucid dreaming. There is often a strong religious element to these studies and beliefs, and many occultists profess adherence to religions such as Gnosticism, Hermeticism, Satanism, Thelema, and Neopaganism. While Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam are generally not considered as occult, some of their modern interpretations can be, such as the interpretation of Hinduism within Theosophy or the various occult interpretations of the Jewish Kabbalah.
Alchemy, is considered an occult practice. Alchemy used to be common among scientists, such as Isaac Newton. During the Age of Enlightenment alchemy and science went their separate ways. Newton was accused of introducing occult agencies into natural science when he proposed that gravity was a force capable of acting over vast distances.

Ghost town

A ghost town is a name for a city or town in which no one lives anymore. It can happen because of economical reasons (for instance, a town of gold miners who cannot find gold anymore), a natural disaster (a flood, a very long drought) or even a man- made disaster (for example, the nuclear fallout that emptied the town of Prypiat, Ukraine). 
Some ghost towns are kept intact as tourist attractions. For example Craco, in the Italian region of Basilicata, is a destination for tourists and pilgrims, as well as a famous film set for movies like "The Passion of the Christ" by Mel Gibson and "Quantum of Solace" by Marc Forster.

Rain dance

A rain dance is a ceremonial dance. It is performed by people who believe it will cause rain and keep their harvest safe. 
Many different types of "rain dances" can be found in many cultures, from Ancient Egypt to certain Native American tribes. In the 20th century Balkans, a ritual known as Paparuda (Romanian) or Perperuna (Slavic) is a type of rain dance. 
The Cherokee tribe, an ethnic Native American tribe from the Southeastern United States used rain dances to both create rain and to remove evil spirits from the earth. The legend of the tribe says that the rain created has the spirits of the former leaders of the tribe. During the rain, these spirits fight the evil spirits in a place between our reality and the spirit world. These raindances are also seen as acts of worship.
Julia M. Butree in her book, describes the "Rain Dance of Zuni" and other Native American dances
Feathers and turquoise are worn during the dance. They symbolize wind and rain. Many traditions of the Rain Dance are passed down through history by people telling their children about them in stories.
In an early type of meteorology, Native Americans in the midwestern parts of modern United States often tracked and followed known weather patterns. They would do a raindance for settlers in return for trade items. This is best known to happen among Osage and Quapaw Indian tribes of Missouri and Arkansas.

<doc id="120359" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=120359" title="Louse">
Louse

Lice (singular: louse), are wingless insects that live in hair. They are all external parasites on every species of bird and most mammalian orders. They are not found on Monotremes and a few eutherian orders, namely the bats (Chiroptera), whales, dolphins and porpoises (Cetacea) and pangolins (Pholidota). There are more than 3,000 different species; three are classified as human lice.
Lice spend their whole life on the host. They are adapted to keep close contact with the host. These adaptations are reflected in their size (0.5–8 mm), stout legs, and claws which are adapted to clinging tightly to hair, fur and feathers. They are also wingless and flattened.
Lice feed on skin (epidermal) debris, feather parts, sebaceous secretions and blood. A louse's color varies from pale beige to dark grey; however, if feeding on blood, it may become considerably darker.
A louse's egg is commonly called a "nit". Lice attach their eggs to their host's hair with specialized saliva which results in a bond that is very difficult to separate without specialized products. Living lice eggs tend to be pale white. Dead lice eggs are more yellow. Lice are very annoying and are difficult to remove, but not impossible. The process is called "nit-picking", and is often done with a close-toothed metal comb. For humans, anti-insect shampoos are available.
The order has traditionally been divided into two suborders; the "sucking lice" (Anoplura) and "chewing lice" (Mallophaga). Four suborders are now recognised:
It has been suggested that the order is contained by the Troctomorpha suborder of Psocoptera. What this means is that lice may have evolved from free-living species of that group.
Humans are unique in that they host three different species of lice: head lice, body lice (which live mainly in clothing), and pubic lice. The DNA differences between head lice and body lice provide corroborating evidence that humans started wearing clothes at approximately 70,000 BCE.
Recent DNA evidence suggests that pubic lice spread to the ancestors of humans approximately 3.3 million years ago from the ancestors of gorillas by sharing the same bed or other communal areas with them, and are more closely related to lice endemic to gorillas than to other lice species infesting humans.

An impala ("Aepyceros melampus") is a medium-sized African antelope. The name "impala" comes from the Zulu language.
The impala is reddish-brown with white hair inside the ears, over each eye and on the chin, upper throat, underparts and buttocks. A narrow black line runs along the middle of the lower back to the tail, and a vertical black stripe appears on the back of each thigh. Impalas have unique brushlike tufts of black hair that cover a scent gland located just above the heel on each hind leg.
The impala can jump more than 10 meters distance and 3 meters high, and can reach running speeds of about 80 to 90 km/h, to escape from predators.
Impalas are found at grassland and woodland edges, usually very close by water.

Biblical Mount Sinai

The Biblical Mount Sinai is a mountain that was written about in the Old Testament. It was written by Moses that the Ten Commandments were given to him by God on Mount Sinai. The name Horeb is sometimes used to describe Mount Sinai. Tradition places it at Jebel Musa (Mount Moses) in the south of the Sinai Peninsula, but some see it as being further north at the Wadi Sudr.

Metroid Prime 3: Corruption

Metroid Prime 3: Corruption is a first-person adventure video game made by Retro Studios and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Wii game console.
This game begins with a meeting between Samus and three other bounty hunters (Basically, hunters who are looking to do good) about a computer virus(computer crashes) caused by Phazon. The four bounty hunters must try and stop it. But in the middle of the meeting, some Space Pirates crash into the frigate(a big space ship) and stop the meeting. Samus and the other bounty hunters must instead stop both the Space Pirates and the virus. Samus lands on the local planet, Norion, and must bring Generators A, B, and C online.
As Samus prepares to activate the last generator, Meta Ridley flies in and breaks the floor of the generator area, and Samus is forced to fight him in a long hole down to the planet's core. She eventually beats him, and brings Generator C online, and heads to the control room. Samus meets up with the other Hunters. Samus takes the keyboard of the control pad, and then Dark Samus attacks the bounty hunters, but Samus survives, as does the rest of the bounty hunters. The rest of the bounty hunters fall into a coma, while Samus manages to destroy the asteroid with the laser (which is connected to the Generators) before she falls into a coma (a deep sleep) herself.
A month later, Samus finds out that Dark Samus' Phazon(like poison in our world but worse) based attacks have corrupted her. She (along with the rest of the bounty hunters) is fitted with a Phazon Enhancement Device (PED) which allows her to use the Phazon within her. She finds out that her fellow bounty hunters have gone missing. Samus now goes to several planets, named Bryyo, Elysia, and the Pirate Homeworld, where she finds that the inhabitants are all slowly being corrupted by the Phazon. Once Samus finishes that, she lands on planet "Phaaze". Seconds after she lands, Samus's PED Suit is in constant Hyper Mode because Phazze's atmosphere is corrupting her, so she needs to drain all at least 10 energy tanks in order to stay "nonCorrupted" . The meter is her energy tanks filling up. If it reaches the top, Samus dies, or becomes so corrupted that she becomes another Dark Samus. Meanwhile, she finally finds Dark Samus and they fight. Samus wins, then corrupts the problem, and then Phaaze is destroyed.
It turned out that Phazze, a planet, was the source of Dark Samus, as well as the source of all Phazon. It would send meteors called "Leviathan Seeds" to some planets, like it did to Tallon IV and Aether, splitting Aether into "Light Aether" and "Dark Aether". It is made of pure Phazon, with gaseous Phazon for its atmosphere, liquid for its "water", and solid for its ground. With its destruction, all the Phazon in the universe is destroyed, even the Phazon in Samus herself. 
This is the first Metroid game for the Nintendo Wii, and so the controls have been changed to fit the controller. There is also a unique mode, called "Hyper Mode". The player uses the Nunchuk to move and use the grapple, as well as Morph Ball and Lock on. He or she also uses the Wii remote (commonly called Wiimote) for Hypermode, as well as all weaponry and jumping, and aiming.

<doc id="120485" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=120485" title="Cicada">
Cicada

Cicadas are small – and "very" noisy – insects. They are kinds of true bugs.
The noisy buzz they make is the male calling to the female using his vibrating panels, called "tymbals", on his sides. When the female, who cannot buzz, hears the buzz of a male, she searches for him. After they mate, the female will use her ovipositor to cut a line into the branch of a tree and lay her eggs there. Adult cicadas don't usually bite. They are usually green or black. Cicadas can also be eaten. It is eaten in countries like China.
Cicadas live in temperate to tropical climates where their large size and unique sound makes them well known. Cicadas are often colloquially called locusts, although they are unrelated to true locusts, which are a kind of grasshopper. Cicadas are related to leafhoppers and spittlebugs.
Cicadas are arranged into two families: Tettigarctidae and Cicadidae. There are two living species of Tettigarctidae, one in southern Australia, and the other in Tasmania.
The family Cicadidae is very widespread. They live on all continents except Antarctica. 
The largest cicadas are in the genera "Pomponia" and "Tacua". There are some 200 species in 38 genera in Australia, about 450 in Africa, about 100 in the Palaearctic, and exactly one species in England, the New Forest cicada, "Melampsalta montana", widely distributed throughout Europe. There are about 150 species in South Africa.
Most of the North American species are in the genus "Tibicen": the "annual" or "jar fly" or "dog-day cicadas" (so named because they emerge in late July and August).
Australian cicadas differ from many other types because of that continent's diversity of climate and terrain. In Australia, cicadas are found on tropical islands and cold coastal beaches around Tasmania; in tropical wetlands; high and low deserts; alpine areas of New South Wales and Victoria; large cities like Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane; and Tasmanian highlands and snowfields.
Forty-two species from five genera populate New Zealand, and all are endemic to New Zealand and the surrounding islands (Norfolk Island, New Caledonia). Many New Zealand cicada species differ from those of other countries by living high up on mountain tops.

Object (computer science)

In Object-oriented programming, an object is an instance of a Class. Objects are an abstraction. They hold both data, and ways to manipulate the data. The data is usually not visible outside the object. It can only be changed by using a well-specified mechanism (usually called "interface").
Suppose there is a bank account; this bank account has a current balance, but it also has a "history" of things that were done. These fields are however not directly accessible. There are methods like "deposit()" and "withdraw()" and "checkBalance()". Most applications (and other objects) only change this object through this interface. 
Banks usually impose a "credit limit". Suppose, there are 1000 dollars on the account. If the client does not have a special agreement with the bank, he cannot take out more money than there is on the account; so he can withdraw() a maximum of 1000 dollars. He might have an agreement with the bank, so he can borrow money from the bank (but has to pay a fee). In that case, he might be able to withdraw 1500 dollars (or 2000 dollars). So the withdraw method has to do a lot of checks as described above.
The account manager might see the account differently, she might have methods to set the maximum amount that can be taken out of the account, or to set the fee or interest rate that the customer has to be pay for the money borrowed.
As an object is an instance of a class; it has certain things from that class. It can perhaps be compared to other objects of that class. Two apples, one red and bigger, the other green and smaller. On the other hand: It is not that easy to compare different objects. A green apple does not have much in common with a steel wrench.

Object-oriented design

Object-Oriented Design (OOD) is a way for the designer of a computer program to specify what a computer program will do, using the way that people think and not using the way that computers think. People think in terms of classes and objects. For example, fruit is a class, and there are different kinds of fruits such as bananas and pineapples. If a computer program designer were specifying to a computer programmer how to create a computer program to manage the fruits in a supermarket, then he or she would specify the program in terms of classes and objects which is how people think.
A computer program called a compiler and/or an interpreter would take the program that the programmer typed in and convert it into a form that a computer can run. Computers really only understand things that are encoded as numbers. Object-Oriented-Design (OOD) uses the power and speed of a computer to allow humans to be more productive in making computer programs, by letting human computer programmers think in terms of how humans think.

Radovan Karadžić

Radovan Karadžić (Serbian Cyrillic: Радован Караџић; born 19 June 1945 in Petnjica, Montenegro, Yugoslavia) used to be a Serbian politician. He was in charge of part of the Bosnian Genocide. From 1995 to 2008, he was a fugitive. He was arrested on 21 July 2008 in Serbia. In 2016, he was convicted of war crimes.
Karadžić was the child of Vuko and Jovanka Karadžić. His father, Vuko (1912–1987), was a shoemaker. His mother, Jovanka (1922–2005), was a peasant girl from northern Montenegro. Her maiden name was Jovanka Jakić. She married Karadžić's father in 1943, at age twenty.
Karadžić's father was in prison for most of his son's childhood. During World War II, Yugoslavia had been taken over by Nazi Germany and the other Axis countries. Karadžić's father had been a member of the Chetniks. This was an army that supported Yugoslavia's original government. Because he was in this army, he was put in prison after the war.
Karadžić moved to Sarajevo in 1960 to study psychiatry at the Sarajevo University School of Medicine. In 1970, he studied anxiety and depression at Næstved Hospital in Denmark. From 1974 to 1975, he got more medical training at Columbia University in New York City.
After he returned to Yugoslavia, Karadžić worked in the Koševo Hospital (the main hospital in Sarajevo). He was also a poet. Another Serbian writer encouraged him to go into politics.
While he was working in the Koševo Hospital, Karadžić made extra money in illegal ways. For example, healthcare workers who wanted to retire early would pay him to say they were disabled. Karadžić would also lie for prisoners who wanted to avoid punishment by saying they were insane when they committed their crimes.
In 1983, Karadžić started working at a hospital in a suburb of Belgrade called Voždovac. With his partner, Momčilo Krajišnik, Karadžić got a loan that was meant to be used for improving agriculture. Instead, he and his partner used the money to build themselves houses in Pale. Pale was a Serb town above Sarajevo that the government had turned into a ski resort.
On 1 November 1984, the two were arrested for fraud. They spent 11 months in jail before their friend Nikola Koljević paid their bail so they could get out. On 26 September 1985, Karadžić was sentenced to three years in prison for embezzlement and fraud. However, since he had already spent over a year in prison, the court did not make Karadžić spend the rest of his sentence in prison.
In 1989, Karadžić helped create the Serb Democratic Party () in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The party's goal was to bring together the country's Bosnian Serbs.
In September 1991, the "Srpska Demokratska Stranka" (SDS) began to create areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina that were ruled only by Serbs. On 15 October 1991, the Bosnian parliament voted that they wanted to rule themselves. Nine days later, a separate Serb Assembly was created, to represent only the Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
On 9 January 1992, the Bosnian Serb Assembly said they had created a new country: the Republic of the Serb people of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Република српског народа Босне и Херцеговине/Republika srpskog naroda Bosne i Hercegovine). On 28 February 1992, the Serb Republic approved its constitution. It also said that it now controlled:
On 6 and 7 April 1992, Europe and the United States accepted that Bosnia was an independent country. Bosnia became a member of the United Nations on 22 May 1992. Karadžić was voted President of this Bosnian Serb government around 13 May 1992. His powers included being in charge of the country's army.
As the head of the Bosnian Serb army, Karadžić was in charge of a campaign to get rid of all the Bosnian Muslims and Croats from villages that the Serbs wanted for themselves.
In 1995, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) indicted Karadžić for committing war crimes against non-Serbs. The ICTY accused Karadžić of ordering the Srebrenica massacre in 1995, where Karadžić's army murdered more than 7,500 Muslims. They also accused him of many other crimes, including:
Karadžić ran away so he could not be tried for these crimes. Until 2008, he hid. The United States government offered a $5 million reward for his arrest.
Karadžić was arrested on 21 July 2008 in Belgrade. He had been pretending to be a doctor of alternative medicine, mostly in Belgrade but also in Vienna, Austria. Karadžić was sent to an ICTY jail in the Hague on 30 July.
Karadžić said that the United States government had protected him while he was hiding, and this was why it took over ten years for him to be found.
Karadžić first appeared before a judge at the ICTY began on 31 July 2008. At that time, the ICTY had found 64 people guilty of war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide during the Yugoslav Wars.
The film "The Hunting Party" was based on Karadžić's life as a fugitive.
On 24 March 2016, Karadžić was found guilty of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. He was sentenced to 40 years in prison.
Karadžić was found guilty of genocide for the Srebrenica massacre. He was also convicted of persecution, extermination, deportation, ethnic cleansing, and murder.

Common Language Specification

A Common Language Specification (CLS) is a document that says how computer programs can be turned into MSIL code. When several languages use the same bytecode, different parts of a program can be written in different languages. Microsoft uses a Common Language Specification for their .NET Framework. To fully interact with other objects regardless of the language they were used in, objects must expose to callers only those features that are common to all the languages they must exchange information with. It was always a dream of Microsoft to unite all different languages into one umbrella and CLS is one step towards that. Microsoft has defined CLS which are nothing but guidelines for languages to follow so that it can communicate with other .NET languages in a seamless manner.
Most of the members defined by types in the .NET Framework class library are able to work with CLS. However, some types in the class library have one or more members that are not able to work with CLS. These members allow support for language features that are not in the CLS.
The CLS was designed to be large enough to include the language constructs that are commonly needed by developers, yet small enough that most languages are able to support it. Any language construct that makes it impossible to quickly confirm the type safety of code was excluded from the CLS so that all languages that can work with CLS can produce verifiable code if they choose to do so.

Auerswald was feared by the prisoners due to his brutality. Executions and brutal punishments made him one of the most terrible guards at Mauthausen. 
After the end of World War II Auerswald was charged by an US-military tribunal in Dachau. The trial document lists a case where a Russian prisoner, begging for his life, was pushed by Auerswald into a fence secured by high voltage. He died immediately. The documentation also mentioned that 300 healthy prisoners were brought from Mauthausen to the sub-camp St. Aegyd. More than 50% died within the next few weeks or became severely sick so that they were brought back to Mauthausen where they died. Auerswald was the head of the St. Aegyd sub-camp at that time.
Auerswald was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging. Later it was changed to life imprisonment.

Battle of Berlin

The Battle of Berlin was one of the last major battles of Second World War. The Battle took place in Berlin from 16 April to 3 May 1945. During the battle the Red Army, along with Polish forces, captured the city of Berlin, Germany. When they captured the Reichstag, Adolf Hitler committed suicide with his new wife by shooting himself in the head and her taking a cyanide pill.
On 12 January 1945 the Soviet and Polish forces began attacking Berlin. In the end of that attack, their forces stood on the Oder River, 60 kilometres east of Berlin. In 1945 the Wehrmacht had few good fighters or good weapons compared to 1944. 
Despite his advisors' opinion, Hitler decided to stay in the city. He heard about the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt on the radio and he hoped the city will be saved.
The battle on the city began in the Seelow Heights. The Seelow Heights are 17 kilometers west of the Oder and 45 kilometres east of Berlin. They were well defended by the "Wehrmacht". On 16 April, the Red Army and Polish Army attacked Seelow Heights. Almost 1,000,000 allies with 20,000 artillery pieces were fighting against 100,000 Germans with 1,200 tanks. Despite this, the German defenders managed to hold the allies for four days.
On 20 April, Hitler's birthday, the allies began to bombard the centre of the city with rockets and artillery. They did not stop until the city surrendered. On 22 April, Hitler, when he knew the Germans plans has failed, cried in anger. He knew the war was as good as lost. One of his generals, Alfred Jodl, thought it would be possible to form a linkup between the army in Berlin, and the 12th Army commanded by Walther Wenck that were fighting the U.S. Army. Hitler agreed to this idea, but those troops could not get to the city.
Hitler remained in his Führerbunker until his death. He knew that escape was nearly impossible. His soldiers knew that too, and wanted to get out. Since there was no hope of winning, Hitler gave orders to his generals and allowed a breakout plan on April 28th. However, this plan went badly, as only a few of the expected number of soldiers managed to get through Soviet lines. On April 29th Hitler authorized another try to break out May 1st.
However, on April 30th the Red Army captured the Reichstag. They were just 500 yards from the Führerbunker. Hitler killed himself by shooting himself in the head with a pistol. Eva Braun, his mistress, killed "herself" by biting on a capsule of cyanide, a very toxic chemical. On May 1st, Helmuth Weidling ordered a break out. However, only one division, named the "Nordland" Division, made it through.
Finally, on May 2, 1945, Nazi Germany surrendered.

<doc id="120569" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=120569" title="Alpaca">
Alpaca

The Alpaca ("Vicugna pacos") is one of the four species of South American camelid, and they are domesticated. It resembles a small llama in superficial appearance. Alpacas are bred for their fiber while Llamas are used to carry burdens.The hoofs of Alpaca is sometimes used as a musical instrument.
They usually eat hay or grasses, but they actually try to chew most of the things, even an empty bottle. However, there are many plants that are poisonous to Alpaca. 
The Alpaca takes about 355 days until the babies are born(11-12 months). They may live up to 20 years (up to 25 years in a zoo). They are as much as 3 or 4 times the opportunity to be mowed fiber in their life. There they live together with Cameroon (sheep)and pygmy goat. 
They were selectively bred for household goods like clothes because they have such good wool.Since the knit made from the alpaca is very warm,the knit is popular in the world.
About 5,000 to 6,000 years ago the natives began the domestication of the vicuna into the present day alpaca as a fiber producing animal. Alpaca are also commonly used as herd guardians. Two or more guardians are sent to live in a paddock of sheep, goats or chickens, where it is their job to chase away foxes and other predators.
There are two main types of alpacas, the huacaya and the suri (sometimes spelled suriya depending on where you are). The main difference between the two is price and appearance. Huacayas are more common which makes them cheaper to buy. They are also easier to take care of because their coats require less maintenance. Suris are more expensive due to their rarity and the fact that their wool can be sold for more because it is more luxurious and thicker. Their coats require more daily maintenance.

Mennonites

The Mennonites are a group of Christian Anabaptists named after Menno Simons (1496–1561). His teachings were a relatively minor influence on the group, though. They are of the historic "peace churches". Mennonites are committed to nonviolence, nonviolent resistance/reconciliation, and pacifism.
There are about 1.5 million Mennonites worldwide as of 2006. There are many different types of mennonite communities in the world. There are those that dress in old-fashioned ways, and others which are hard to tell apart from other people leading a modern lifestyle. Most Mennonites are in the United States and Democratic Republic of Congo, but Mennonites can also be found in tight-knit communities in at least 51 countries on six continents or scattered amongst the populace of those countries.
Mennonites have an international distinction among Christian denominations in disaster relief. They also place a strong theological emphasis on voluntary service. Mennonite Disaster Service, based in North America, provides both immediate and long-term responses to hurricanes, floods, and other disasters. Mennonite Central Committee provides disaster relief around the world alongside their long-term international development programs. Other programs offer a variety of relief efforts and services throughout the world.
In the last few decades some Mennonite groups have also become more actively involved with peace and social justice issues, helping to found Christian Peacemaker Teams and Mennonite Conciliation Service.

Hutterites

Hutterites are a group of Protestanŧ Christians. They are an anabaptist movement; they think believers should be baptized (a second time). Their movement was founded by Jacob Hutter who lived in the 16th century. The main difference to the Mennonites is that they think the Bible should be read literally. They also share everything they have; there is no private property. Within the Hutterites, there are a few different groups. Some of the groups are more liberal than others. Usually, the different groups also have different leaders. 
Today, there are about 50.000 Hutterites; most of them live in the Canada and the United States. Like the Amish they still speak a dialect of German. In 2005, there were about 465 settlements, with 60 to 150 people each. The people who emigrated to the US or Canada had one of the following family names: Decker, Entz, Glanzer, Gross, Hofer, Kleinsasser, Knels, Mändel, Stahl, Tschetter, Waldner, Walther, Wipf, Wollmann, or Wurz.

MediaFire was originally founded on August 2006, the company was established in the San Frasisco Bay Area by a group of website enthusiasts and entrepreneurs who had a difficult time with sending rather large emails and files and FTP.
Together they decided to create a site that would resolve those issues, for a more simple method of transferring these files and other media.On October 2006 MediaFire was actually launched, and did rather well with producing a site where user of all ages could share files with ease and feel secure about their files. And this site only continued to grow, and more features were invented such as:
Unlimited cloud Storage, Branding tools and the ability to share files with friends and family and other users.

Acronis True Image

Acronis True Image is a program to make disk images. It is made by Acronis. True Image can create an image of a disk while it is running Microsoft Windows or Linux, or offline by booting from CD/DVD, USB flash drives, PXE, or other bootable media. As a disk imaging solution, True Image can restore the previously captured image to another disk, effectively replicating the structure and contents to the new disk, also allowing partition resizing if the new disk is of different capacity.
File systems supported by software:
In addition to the officially supported filesystems, Acronis True Image also provides raw sector backup and restore options for all other filesystems. 'Raw' mode provides support for a file system that is corrupt, or that is not officially supported, by capturing a complete image of all sectors on the disk. This method results in a larger image file as it is not able to compress, resize, or selectively restore files on the unrecognized filesystem.

The Young Ones

The Young Ones is a British sitcom, first seen in 1982, on BBC2. Its anarchic sense of humour, in the 1980s, made the actors famous in the UK. Soon after that, it was shown to Americans on MTV, one of the first shows on the new channel that was not mostly about music.
The programme was about four college students sharing a house: violent punk rocker Vyvyan (Adrian Edmondson), the stuck-up anarchist Rick (Rik Mayall), the suffering hippy Neil (Nigel Planer), and the mysterious Mike (Christopher Ryan). It also starred Alexei Sayle, who played their landlord, Jerzei Balowski, and other members of the Balowski family.
The show was like a regular sitcom, with violent slapstick, silly turns in the plot, and surrealism.
Although the series was set in North London, many outdoors scenes were filmed in Bristol. All four characters went to the fictional "Scumbag College", but they were never shown in a classroom, and were hardly ever seen studying.
The show was voted #31 in the BBC's Best Sitcom poll in 2004.
The series' beginnings were in London's comedy clubs in the late 1970s. Most of the cast became popular at The Comedy Store. Alexei Sayle was the main act, drawing attention as the manic, aggressive Master of ceremonies. Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall worked as a double act, 20th Century Coyote, and later became The Dangerous Brothers. Nigel Planer was in a double act with Peter Richardson called "The Outer Limits."
As The Comedy Store became popular, Sayle, 20th Century Coyote and The Outer Limits, with French and Saunders and Arnold Brown, set up their own club called The Comic Strip in nearby Soho. The Comic Strip became one of the most popular comedy clubs in London, and one person who liked it a lot was Jeremy Isaacs of Channel 4. Peter Richardson then made a deal for six half-hour shows on Channel 4, using the group as comedy actors instead of stand-up performers.
The first of this series, "The Comic Strip Presents...", was on Channel 4 on 2 November 1982. After this, the BBC made a deal with Edmondson, Mayall, Richardson, Planer and Sayle to star in another sitcom in the same style. Paul Jackson was put in as a producer.
The series was written by Mayall with his girlfriend Lise Mayer, and with Ben Elton (who went to Manchester University with Mayall and Edmondson). Richardson was first going to play Mike, but clashed with Jackson. He was replaced by Christopher Ryan, the only member of the group who was not a stand-up comedian.
The series was centered around the unclean house where the students lived during their time at Scumbag College.
When it was first on television, the show got attention for violent slapstick. Though new to mainstream audiences, Mayall and Edmondson had been using it in 20th Century Coyote for some time. The show also had some very strange parts, such as puppets playing talking animals or objects. Confusion was added with pieces in the middle that were not part of the main plot.
Episodes in the second series sometimes had "flash frames" (three frames, lasting 1/8 of a second), but these were cut out of some repeats. They were included to make fun of the British and American public's fear of subliminal messages in television and music. The images included the words "Carry On Cowboy" (the name of a 1965 film), a rusty dripping tap, a leaping frog, a dove in flight, a skier, and a hand making pottery.
The episodes ran 35 minutes, and many episodes were cut when repeated on the BBC or satellite channels.
In the United States, "The Young Ones" ran on PBS, MTV and, in 1994, on Comedy Central.
The series' theme song featured the cast singing Cliff Richard and The Shadows UK #1 song "The Young Ones". Throughout the series there were many references to Richard, as Mayall's character was a fan.
The theme song over the end credits was written by Peter Brewis, who also created incidental music on many episodes.
In 1984, after the second season, Planer (in character as Neil) reached No. 2 in the UK charts with a version of Traffic's "Hole In My Shoe". It went with "Neil's Heavy Concept Album", a loose collection of songs and spoken comedy with appearances by "Young Ones" actors Dawn French and Stephen Fry.
In 1986, the cast sang "Living Doll" with Cliff Richard and Hank Marvin for Comic Relief. The song, a reworking of his 1959 hit, reached the top of the UK Charts.
Most episodes had a musical guest performing in the house or street. By including the groups, the show could be called variety rather than light entertainment by the BBC and was given a bigger budget than a sitcom. This also helped get several British bands to be more popular with American viewers, such as Dexys Midnight Runners, Motörhead, and Madness. This last group was in two episodes.
Some of these performances were cut from the DVD for copyright reasons. Some musical acts were also cut out for similar reasons on some satellite reruns.
Played by Nigel Planer, Neil Pye, the hippy, is a clinically depressed, suicidal pacifist, vegetarian and environmentalist working towards a Peace Studies degree. He is victimised by other housemates (especially Rick and Vyvyan) and forced to do the housework, including shopping, cleaning and cooking. He is never acknowledged for it (unless it goes wrong).
Neil is pessimistic and believes everyone and everything hates him, which is mostly true, though he does have some friends, two hippys, one also named Neil and one named Warlock. He does not like technology except for videos, and he speaks out for Vegetable Rights and Peace. He is also an insomniac, believing that "sleep gives you cancer".
Neil wants the others to feel sorry for him, or just acknowledge his presence. To get attention, he tries anything from repeatedly banging himself on the head with a frying pan to attempting suicide. He claims "the most interesting thing that ever happens to me is sneezing".
In the second series, his parents - who appear in the episode "Sick" - are revealed to be upper middle class. They are conservative Tories who look down on Neil.
Neil also says 'heavy' a lot.
Played by Rik Mayall, Rick is an anarchist who is studying sociology and/or domestic sciences (depending on the episode). Rick writes poetry and calls himself "The People's Poet".
Rick is a hypocritical, tantrum-throwing attention-seeker who loves Cliff Richard. Rick tries to impress the others with what he thinks is his wit, talent and humour, but is really none of these. He insults and often physically assaults Neil. He fights and bickers with Vyvyan, and attempts to impress Mike.
Rick is a vegetarian, and says he wishes everyone to love each other like brothers. However, he rarely does anything that can be called brotherly love.
Rick is unlikeable, and so selfish that he believes he is the "most popular member of the flat" even though his housemates really hate him. Vyvyan describes Rick's name as being spelled "with a silent P". Although the other members dislike and ignore Rick, he is heard to say that they "really are terrific friends".
Believing himself the 'People's Poet' or the "spokesperson for a generation", Rick exaggerates or lies about his political activism and working class background, and in the last episode "Summer Holiday", it is suggested he really comes from an upper class, Conservative background.
While he sees himself as an anarchist, he likes the ideas of Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky and states his interest in them in several episodes. However, he claims to dislike Margaret Thatcher, as is noted by his efforts threatening to blow up England with a bomb in the episode "Bomb" if she does not do something "to help the kids, by this afternoon." This is also noticed in "The Young Ones Book," first published by Sphere Books, where negative references are made to Thatcher and the Conservative Party.
Rick speaks loudly and cannot pronounce his "r"s sometimes.
Played by Adrian Edmondson, Vyvyan is an orange-haired, mohican punk rocker and medical student. He is extremely violent and regularly attacks Neil and Rick with pieces of wood, cricket bats and other large objects. He never hurts Mike, whom he respects. He hates Rick more than he does Neil, taking every chance to insult and attack him. For example, when Rick, Mike and Neil meet his mother at a bar in the episode "Boring", he calls both Neil and Mike his friends, but not Rick, whom he calls "a complete bastard." Although Rick and Vyvyan hate each other, this makes them all but inseparable; the two spend more time together than apart, or with the other housemates.
Vyvyan owns a yellow Ford Anglia, with red flames painted along the sides, and a Glaswegian hamster named Special Patrol Group ("SPG" for short) which he is very fond of, even though SPG is also often subjected to Vyvyan's extreme violence. His mother is a barmaid and former shoplifter, who before "Boring" had not seen Vyvyan in ten years and has no idea who his father is.
Vyvyan has inhuman strength on occasion (moving entire walls with his bare hands, lifting Neil above his head in a fight with Rick, biting through a brick and even re-attaching his own head after it was cut off), surviving a pick-axe through the head, and he eats just about anything; televisions, dead rats, cornflakes, or cornflakes with ketchup.
Although he is a homicidal maniac, Vyvyan can be friendly and creative; in one episode ("Flood"), he made his own potion to change a person into an axe-wielding homicidal maniac. He has more friends than the others but "he doesn't like any of them." He often causes damage such as wiring the doorbell to a bomb, and adding a 289 CID Ford V-8 engine to the vacuum cleaner, which proceeds to suck up the carpet, the floorboards and a friend of Neil's. Vyvyan also seems to be the only member of the group with a driving licence.
Played by Christopher Ryan, Mike was the oddest of the four. He is the assumed leader of the group, despite being rather shorter than the others, and does not involve himself in the battles between the other three. He makes puns, which are either deliberately cheap or humorous.
He often uses deep-sounding phrases that confuse the others (for example, when asked by Rick if he stole his apple, Mike replies "Well, if you're gonna sin you might as well be original."). Mike is supposedly the ladies' man of the bunch, and brags about his prowess with women, although he is eventually forced to admit his virginity to the others in "Nasty." Though he is a virgin, as are the rest of the housemates, he always tries to get a date with the opposite sex, being quite forward and unsuccessful.
A con artist, he always has some kind of plan to make quick money, such as renting out Rick's bedroom as a roller disco, and trying to auction off the unexploded atom bomb that fell into the house. Mike attends Scumbag College only in name, as he has blackmailed his tutor and the Dean of the school for grants, and apparently passing grades. In "Summer Holiday" he says "I think I'll ask for one of those Ph.D.s next year."
While Mike often does things at the expense of his housemates, he usually does not show the sort of open hostility that the others do, and seems to cause them trouble only when it benefits him. He has, however, managed to nail his own legs to a table, and accidentally knocked Neil out during a game of cricket. We only see violence done to him once or twice (at the end of the "Living Doll" video, when Vyvyan knocks him unconscious with a hammer and in "Summer Holiday", when Neil transforms into the Incredible Hulk, who picks up Mike and throws him to the ground, however it turns out it was only Neil's imagination).
Throughout the two series, Alexei Sayle regularly appeared as many different characters, putting his own material into the programme in ways that copied his stand up comedy routines. His main role was that of the flat's landlord Jerzy (Jeremy) Balowski, appearing in "Demolition", "Flood" and "Summer Holiday". The rest of the time, he played various male members of "The Balowski Family", including nephew Alexei Balowski (a protest singer), son Reggie Balowski (an international arms dealer), brother Billy Balowski (a lunatic who believed he was a taxi driver), cousin Tommy Balowski (a drunk), escaped convict Brian Damage Balowski, and a medieval jester "Jester Balowski" (with Helen Lederer as his sidekick).
In the second series, Sayle's characters also included a train driver, a Mussolini look-alike (by day the head of the local police force, by night an entrant in the Eurovision Song Contest), and "Harry the Bastard" (manager of the local Rumbelows store, disguised as a South African vampire).
Mike is the natural "leader" of the house. Always trying to make himself appear more important and exciting than he really is, he does appear to have done some of the things he claims to have done (such as getting Bambi the "Babycham" commercial in "Bambi"). He gets little hostility from the other members of the house. If there is any good or friendly relationship in the house it is between Mike and Vyvyan. Vyvyan accepts Mike's role as the house leader, whereas Mike sometimes uses Vyvyan's muscles and willingness to act forcibly, to enforce his own authority.
Neil is the second least liked of the four, although he is the only one who does any kind of household chores and is therefore needed by the other three.
Rick is the least liked. Rick thinks very highly of himself. He tells poor jokes and stories (but finds them hilarious himself), is a wanna-be anarchist (although deep-down he is quite conservative) and frequently acts like a child when he does not get his way. He generally takes out his frustration (when trying to impress the others) on Neil, since Neil never sticks up for himself and is ignored by the others. However, the one time when Neil looked as if he was going to retaliate, Rick fled. Most of his anger comes up in his endless battles with Vyvyan, which he always loses.
In the final episode, the four students steal a red AEC Routemaster after robbing a bank, only to drive it over a cliff, and it explodes into flames at the bottom of a quarry.
The end of the series was not the last appearance of "The Young Ones". For the British charity television appeal Comic Relief, the four recorded a song and video for Cliff Richard's "Living Doll", along with Richard and Shadows guitarist Hank B. Marvin. (Alexei Sayle was not involved, but had already achieved chart success in 1984 with "'Ullo John, Gotta New Motor?".) At the 1986 Comic Relief stage show, they performed the song live.
Mayall, Planer and Edmondson reunited in 1986 for the Elton-written "Filthy Rich & Catflap". The series had many of the same characteristics as "The Young Ones" as did Mayall and Edmondson's next sitcom "Bottom". Ryan, for his part, was regularly recruited to play roles on associated series (such as "Happy Families", "Bottom" and "Absolutely Fabulous").
DVD releases have been somewhat basic: only the U.S. "Every Stoopid Episode" edition featured documentaries, and no extra footage was included. Musical references proved difficult to clear, so "The Sound of Silence" and "Subterranean Homesick Blues" were cut from the U.S. editions.
A new DVD release of all episodes ("Extra Stoopid Edition") came out in November of 2007, with new documentaries and two commentary tracks. This edition restores "The Sound of Silence" and "Subterranean Homesick Blues," but is missing other scenes.
In 1986 MTV bought half the episodes to run on their cable systems during 1987.

Napoléon III

Napoléon III, also known as Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte (1808–1873) was the first President of the French Republic and the last monarch of France. Made president by popular vote in 1848, Napoleon III ascended to the throne on 2 December 1852, the forty-eighth anniversary of his uncle, Napoleon I's, coronation. He ruled as Emperor of the French until September 1870, when he was captured in the Franco-Prussian War. 
Napoleon III, generally known as "Louis Napoléon" before he became emperor, was the son of Louis Bonaparte. He married Hortense de Beauharnais, the daughter by the first marriage of Napoleon's wife Josephine de Beauharnais. Louis-Napoléon was a second son and a replacement child. His older brother, Napoléon Charles Bonaparte, died at age four. During Napoleon I's reign, Louis-Napoléon's parents had been made king and queen of a French puppet state, the Kingdom of Holland. After Napoleon I's military defeats and deposition in 1815 and the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in France, all members of the Bonaparte dynasty were forced into exile. He was quietly exiled to the United States of America, and spent four years in New York. He also sailed to Central America. Then he secretly returned to France and attempted yet another coup in August 1840, sailing with some hired soldiers into Boulogne. In 1844, his uncle Joseph died, making him the direct heir apparent to the Bonaparte claim. Two years later, his father Louis died, making Louis-Napoléon the clear Bonapartist candidate to rule France. 
Louis-Napoléon lived within the borders of the United Kingdom until the revolution of February 1848 in France deposed Louis-Philippe and established a Republic. He was now free to return to France, which he immediately did. 
In 1848, he was elected President of France in a land slide victory. He won the election because of his popular name and French people hoped that he would return his uncle's glory. He used his rank as stepping stone to greater power. Finally in 1852, he crowned himself as Emperor Napoleon III and the Second French Empire was born.In 1856, Eugenie gave birth to a legitimate son and heir, Louis Napoléon, the Prince Impérial. 
On 28 April 1855 Napoleon survived an attempted assassination. On 14 January 1858 Napoleon and his wife escaped another assassination attempt, plotted by Felice Orsini.
Until about 1861, Napoleon's regime exhibited decidedly authoritarian characteristics, using press censorship to prevent the spread of opposition, manipulating elections, and depriving the Parliament of the right to free debate or any real power.
A far more dangerous threat to Napoleon, however, was looming. France saw its dominance on the continent of Europe eroded by Prussia's crushing victory over Austria in the Austro-Prussian War in June–August 1866. The Prussian forces under Chancellor Otto von Bismarck then began the Franco-Prussian War This war proved disastrous for France, and was instrumental in giving birth to the German Empire, which would take France's place as the major land power on the continent of Europe. In battle against Prussia in 1870 the Emperor was captured at the Battle of Sedan and was deposed by the forces of the Third Republic in Paris two days later.
Napoleon spent the last few years of his life in exile in England, with Eugenie and their only son. The family lived at Camden Place Chislehurst (then in Kent), where he died on 9 January 1873. He was haunted to the end by bitter regrets and by painful memories of the battle at which he lost everything.
Napoleon was originally buried at St. Mary's, the Catholic Church in Chislehurst. However, after his son died in 1879 fighting in the British Army against the Zulus in South Africa, the bereaved Eugenie decided to build a monastery. The building would house monks driven out of France by the anti-religious laws of the Third Republic, and would provide a suitable resting place for her husband and son. 
An important legacy of Napoleon III's reign was the rebuilding of Paris. Part of the design decisions were taken in order to reduce the ability of future revolutionaries to challenge the government by capitalizing on the small, medieval streets of Paris to form barricades. However, this should not overshadow the fact that the main reason for the complete transformation of Paris was Napoleon III's desire to modernize Paris based on what he had seen of the modernizations of London during his exile there in the 1840s.

Saint Joseph

Joseph (Hebrew יוֹסֵף, "Yosef"; , "Iosíf") is a figure in the Gospels, the husband of Mary, the mother of Jesus and the step father of Jesus. In Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Anglican Christian traditions, he is regarded as Saint Joseph.
The Gospel of Luke says that the angel Gabriel came to Mary to tell her that she would give birth to a Son and she should call him Jesus and that he would save people from their sins. Mary said "How can this happen? I am a virgin!" The angel said "With God, anything can happen!"
When Joseph found out that Mary was pregnant, he decided to privately break the engagement. But then he had a dream. An angel told him that the baby was the Son of God. 
At this time, the Roman Emperor, Caesar Augustus, made a law that everyone in the Roman Empire must pay tax. Everyone had to go back to the town that their family came from, to have their name put on the tax lists. Joseph came from Bethlehem, which was called "The City of David". Joseph took Mary to Bethlehem and she gave birth to the baby, Jesus, in a stable, because there was no room for them.

West Flanders (; French: "(Province de) Flandre-Occidentale"; German: "Westflandern") is one of the five provinces of the Flemish Region, also named Flanders, and also is one of the ten provinces of Belgium. It is the westernmost province in Flanders.
Its capital is Bruges (, , ).
The whole Belgian North Sea coast, an important tourism destination, lies in West Flanders. A tram line runs the length of the coast, from De Panne on the French border, via the port of Ostend (), to Knokke-Heist on the Dutch frontier.
The province of West Flanders lies in the most densely populated area of Western Europe. It has inhabitants, and a population density of inhabitants per km². It borders the North Sea, northern France, Zeeland in the Netherlands, the Flemish province of East Flanders () and the Walloon province of Hainaut () in Belgium. West Flanders is the only Belgian province that borders both France and The Netherlands.
The province has an area of . In terms of area, it is the largest province in the Flemish Region and the fifth largest in Belgium.
West Flanders has a very flat landscape with polders, except for a row of dunes along the coast and an area with small hills known as the 'Westvlaamse Bergen', with the Kemmelberg (159 m) being the highest point in the province.
The main rivers in the province are the Leie () and Yser (). The Yser flows into the North Sea at the town of Nieuwpoort and the Leie flows into the Scheldt river.
In the north of the province, most industry is concentrated in and around the cities of Bruges and Ostend. Both cities also have important seaports: the port of Bruges-Zeebrugge and the port of Ostend. The south is known for its textile industry.
Tourism is also an important industry in West Flanders. Major touristic attractions include the Belgian coast, the historic centre of Bruges, and places where there were battles around Ypres during World War I.
The province of West Flanders is divided into 8 arrondissements and a total of 64 municipalities.

Oneness Pentecostalism

Oneness Pentecostalism, also known as Apostolic Pentecostalism, is a movement of Christianity that split from the Pentecostal movement, at around 1914. Followers believe that the Bible was inspired by God. 
""Oneness"" means that they believe that God is one being, not three persons (like in the Trinity doctrine), and that Jesus is God in human flesh – fully god and fully human. This makes them different from most Unitarians who say that the son of god was only man. ""Apostolic"" means that they follow the Apostolic doctrine (by the 12 Apostles in the early Church). ""Pentecostal"" means that they put an emphasis on the moving of the Holy Spirit (like speaking in tongues) as was done on the Day of Pentecost.

Linux kernel

Linux is an operating system kernel used by a group of Unix-like operating systems. These are known as Linux operating systems. 
The Linux kernel is released with the GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2) and developed by programmers worldwide.
In April 1991, Linus Torvalds, then 21 years old, started working on some simple ideas for an operating system. Then, on 25 August 1991, Torvalds posted to "comp.os.minix":
After the post, many people contributed code to the project. By September 1991, Linux version 0.01 was released. It had 10,239 lines of code. In October 1991, Linux version 0.02 was released.
A newsgroup "alt.os.linux" was started, and on January 19 1992, the first post to alt.os.linux was made. On March 31 1992, alt.os.linux became "comp.os.linux".
The X Window System was soon moved to Linux. In March 1992, Linux version 0.95 was the first to be capable of running X. This large version number jump (from 0.1x to 0.9x) was because of a feeling that a version 1.0 with no major missing parts would be released soon. 
On March 14 1994, Linux 1.0.0 was released, with 176,250 lines of code. In March 1995, Linux 1.2.0 was released (310,950 lines of code).
Linus decided, on May 9 1996, to adopt Tux the penguin as mascot for Linux.
Version 2 of Linux, released on June 9, 1996, was a landmark. Strong development continued:
Currently a new kernel version is released in every 2 3/4 months.
In the start, Torvalds released Linux under a license which did not allow anyone to sell it. This was soon changed to the GNU General Public License (GPL), during version 0.12. This license allows distribution and sale of modified and unmodified versions of Linux but requires that all those copies be released under the same license and be accompanied by the complete corresponding source code. 
Torvalds has said licensing Linux under the GPL as the "best thing I ever did."

Sara Evans (born February 5, 1971) is a traditional country singer born in Boonville, Missouri. She has had several #1 hits, gold albums and platinum albums.
Music was a big part of her life when she was young. At age 8, she was hit by a car in front of her house and broke both of her legs. She spent months in a wheelchair and kept singing to pay her hospital bills.
At age 16, she began performing in a nightclub in Columbia, Missouri. She did this for two years. At age 20, she moved to Nashville, Tennessee because she wanted to be a country music singer. She met musician Craig Schelske there. A year later, they moved to Oregon, but when they married, they moved back to Nashville.
In 1995, Sara began recording demos. Someone named Harland Howard was impressed by them so much he decided to help her get a contract. This paid off when she signed with RCA Records.
Her first album under RCA was called "Three Chords and the Truth", released in 1997. People liked it for being traditional, and it was in many Top 10 lists for that year.
However, country music radio didn't like it that much. None of the singles made the Top 40.
In 1998, Sara released her next album, "No Place That Far". People didn't like it because it was more of a pop-country sound. The first single (Cryin' Game) didn't do anything, but the next single (No Place That Far, a duet with Vince Gill) became a #1 hit. Because of that the album was certified gold.

Georg Cantor

Georg Cantor (3 March 1845 - 6 January 1918) was an important German mathematician. He founded set theory and worked on transfinite numbers.
Cantor was born in St Petersburg, Russia. His parents were Danish of pure Jewish descent. His father was Protestant. He was a rich merchant. His mother was Roman Catholic. She was very artistic. When his father became ill in 1856 the family moved to Frankfurt. Georg went to private schools and then to gymnasien in Darmstadt and Wiesbaden. He soon showed that he was brilliant at maths. His father wanted him to be an engineer but Georg persuaded him to let him study mathematics. He spent a short time studying at the University of Zürich, but soon went to Berlin where he studied physics, philosophy and mathematics. He was very influenced by the teaching of Weierstrass, Kummer and Kronecker, who were later to become his enemies. He wrote a doctoral thesis in which he said that asking questions was more important than finding the answers. He was talking about a problem that Carl Friedrich Gauss had left unanswered.
Cantor taught for a time at a girls’ school in Berlin, then he became a lecturer in Halle where he remained for the rest of his life. He became full professor there in 1879. Cantor worked on the theory of numbers and then on trigonometric series, starting with ideas that had been developed by Bernhard Riemann on complex variables. He sent a paper on algebraic numbers to be published in Crelle's Journal, but Kronecker was against it. However, Dedekind supported Cantor, and eventually the article was published. This article showed that Cantor was a great mathematician.
When his father died in 1863 he had enough money to build a house for his wife and five children.
Cantor thought that infinite numbers really existed, and used ideas from ancient and medieval philosophy to prove his point. Kronecker disagreed with him. He thought that only integers existed. Kronecker said that “God made integers and all the rest is the work of man”. Kronecker stopped Cantor from being offered a professorship in Berlin, a position he ought to have had since he was one of the greatest mathematicians in the world. Cantor stayed at Halle and continued to work into his old age, although he often suffered from fits of depression. He often lost his temper, but he was also a very kind man. He always gave encouragement to young mathematicians with new ideas. He did not want them to suffer like he had because of older mathematicians who felt threatened by new ideas. A lot of Cantor’s work led eventually to what is called “new mathematics” in schools today.
Cantor died in a mental hospital in Halle on 6 January 1918.

Pay-per-view

Pay-per-view (often abbreviated PPV) is a way that people can pay to watch events on television in their homes. The event is shown at the same time to everyone ordering it. This is different than video on demand systems which lets people see the event at any time. Common events include movies, sporting events, and pornographic movies.
The first major pay-per-view event was on September 16, 1981. This event was Sugar Ray Leonard and Thomas "Hitman" Hearns boxing for the Welterweight Championship. Viacom Cablevision in Nashville, Tennessee, was the first system to offer the event. Over fifty percent of its customers paid to see the fight. Viacom's Marketing Director, Pat Thompson, put together the fight. He later put together other PPV fights, wrestling matches, and even a Broadway play.
After leaving Viacom, Thompson became head of Sports View. He produced the first pay-per-view football game on October 16, 1983. Sports View was important in creating pay-per-view networks. It was a part of creating TigerVision for LSU, TideVision for Alabama, and UT Vol Seat for Tennessee. Sports View also produced the Ohio State-Michigan Football game on PPV in November of 1983.
In 1985, the first U.S. cable channels to show only pay-per-view, "Viewers Choice", "Cable Video Store", and "Request TV" began operation within days of each other. Viewers Choice was available to both home satellite dish and cable customers. Request TV was available to only cable viewers at first. Dish owners could not use it until the 1990s.
The term "pay-per-view" became more well known in the 1990s when companies like iN DEMAND, HBO, and Showtime started using it to show movies and other things. In Demand would show movies, concerts, and other events at prices between $3.99 to $49.99. HBO and Showtime would offer championship boxing, with prices between $14.99 to $54.99.
Pay-per-view is also a very important way for professional wrestling companies like World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) , Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) , Ring of Honor (ROH) and Asistencia Asesoría y Administración to earn money.
The first pay-per-view system tested in the United states was the Zenith Phonevision system. In 1949, it used telephone lines to take and receive orders. The telephone lines were also used to descramble the signal on the television. Tests were run for 90 days in Chicago. In 1950, Skiatron tested its system on WOR in New York City. The system used IBM punch cards to descramble the signal. Both systems showed that they could be used but were not allowed to be used by the FCC.
One of the first pay-per-view systems on cable was the Optical Systems. It was first used in 1972 in San Diego. These early systems quickly went out of business, as the cable industry started using satellite technology. This caused systems, for example Home Box Office, which had people pay a constant amount of money each month to became popular.
Pay-per-view was first used in the United Kingdom with the use of satellite television and cable systems.
Pay-per-view was first used by Foxtel to home television in Australia and New Zealand in the early 2000s. Sky Pacific in Fiji and other Pacific Island Nations started using it in 2006.

Dhaka District

Dacca District () is a district in the centre of Bangladesh. The district is part of the Dhaka Division, more than half of the district is made up of Dacca - the capital of the district and of Bangladesh too.
Dhaka has a very old history, the city area of Dhaka was ruled by the Buddhist and Hindu kingdoms century. 
After the Sena dynasty, Dhaka was ruled first by the Turkish and the Afghan governors from the Delhi Sultanate before the arrival of the Mughals in 1608.
During the rule of the Mughal the district was famous for its textile products - especially the Muslin. The Mughal governor Islam Khan was the first administrator of the city. Khan named the town "Jahangir Nagar" ("City of Jahangir") in honour of the Mughal emperor Jahangir, although this name was dropped soon after Jahangir's death.
The city grew in size quite a lot under Mughal general Shaista Khan. The city then measured 19 by 13 kilometres (12 by 8 mi), with almost a million people. The city then passed to the control of the British East India Company in 1765 after the Battle of Plassey. The number of people in the city fell very much as the prominence of Kolkata rose, but development eventually followed. A modern civic water supply system was introduced in 1874 and electricity supply launched in 1878. The Dhaka Cantonment was established near the city, serving as a base for British and Indian soldiers.

Proprietary software

Proprietary (or closed source) software does not let people see or change source code of the computer software. It is the opposite of Free software. Proprietary software is usually created by businesses who want to sell their software, but some programs that are free to use are still proprietary because the user is not allowed to change them. With proprietary software, only the people that make the software can see and change the code.
Even if the people who make the program give the source code to other people, the program will be proprietary if they do not allow to do important things like these:
Most companies who sell their software for money (and even some who do not charge money for it) make it proprietary source. This makes it harder for people to copy or change the software, or to use the source code to make similar software.

<doc id="120808" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=120808" title="Kala Dhaka">
Kala Dhaka

Kala Dhaka which also used to known as the Black Mountain of Hazara is a mountain range and a former tribal area of Mansehra District, Hazara Division, of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. Since 2011 it is a new district of the Hazara division.
Kala Dhaka lies next to the Agror valley of Oghi area to the east and by Tanawal to the south. The range has a length of 25 to 30 miles from north to south and a height of 8,000 feet above sea-level. The river Indus goes through the most northern but and then moves to the south. Between the river and the top of the range the western areas are occupied by some sections of the Yusufzai tribe. The rest of the range is held by another indigenous aboriginal tribe, the Swatis. The Black Mountain has long narrow ridges with higher peaks every now and again. It also has valleys in which there are villages where the tribes live. The upper parts of the ridge are covered with thick forests of pine, oak, sycamore, horse-chestnut, and wild cherry; but the slopes are stony and barren.
The British sent armies more than four times to try and control the Black Mountain Tribes from 1852 to 1892, because some leaders of the tribes opposed the British Government.
In 1851 two officers of the British Customs department in a place called Tanawal were killed. The British believed they were killed by the Hasanzai sept of the Yusufzai tribe, so the British then sent an army led by Colonel Mackeson, which destroyed a number of tribal strongholds. In 1868 the Yusufzai helped by the Khan of Agror, who was upset that the British had set up a police post at Oghi in the Agror valley, attacked that post with many men. But he was forced to move back.
The Khan of Tanawal (who later became the Nawab of Amb (princely state)) who remained loyal to the British, faced attacks by tribes who didn't like the British. Then a large number of the tribes began marching against the British, the British managed to stop them and force them back - however during the fighting twenty-one British villages had been burnt. The British then organised an army under General Wilde - he and his men managed to take over all of the Black Mountain and forced the tribes to accept British rule.
In 1888 the British blocked the area due to the raids by the Hasanzai and Akazai tribes who were being helped by the Madda Khel tribe into the Agror valley. While the British were planning tougher attacks - Major Battye and Captain Urmston and some soldiers of the 5th Gurkhas were surprised and killed by the Gujar tribe (who were allies of the Akazai section of the Yusufzai tribe).
Hashim Khan, who was the chief of the Hasanzai and Akazai, was blamed for starting the attack. The British then sent an armies against the tribes in the same year (1881), the tribes had to pay a lot money to the British and also had to agree that Hashim Ali was not allowed to live there any more. The British then made Ibrahim Khan, a relative and enemy of Hashim Khan, ruler. Investigations also revealed that the Khan of Agror had been behind Hashim, and the tribes, inciting them to rebellion to fulfil his own designs. As a result, the Agror Khan was arrested and imprisoned in Hasan Abdal, Punjab and his estates permanently forfeited in 1889, a limited "jagir" allowance given in lieu, since.
In 1890 the tribe stopped the march of British troops along the crest of the Black Mountain, and so an army was sent against them in the spring of 1891. As soon as the troops left, some local Hindustanis and Madda Khel broke their agreement with the British Government by letting Hashim Khan return. In 1892 the British sent their armies again to fight the tribes - this ultimately ended with the tribes being defeated by British.
Kala Dhaka was badly affected by the 2005 Pakistan earthquake, according to a report in Time magazine:

Geography of Romania

With an area of , Romania is the biggest country in southeastern Europe. It is the twelfth-largest in Europe. A large part of Romania's border with Serbia and Bulgaria is made by the Danube. The Danube is joined by the Prut River. The Prut River makes the border with the Republic of Moldova. The Danube then flows into the area of the Black Sea inside of Romania, which forms the Danube Delta. The Danube Delta is the second biggest one of the best kept deltas in Europe. It is also a biosphere reserve and a biodiversity World Heritage Site. Some of the other major rivers in Romania are the Siret, which runs from the north to the south of Moldavia; the Olt, which runs from the Carpathian Mountains to Oltenia; and the Mureş, which runs through Transylvania from the east to the west.
The land in Romania is equally divided among mountainous, hilly and lowland areas. The Carpathian Mountains make up a big part of the center of Romania. 14 of its mountain ranges are taller than 2,000 meters. The tallest mountain in Romania is Moldoveanu Peak ().
The Danube is the longest river in Romania. It travels about 1,075 kilometers, almost 40% of its length, through Romania. Almost all of Romania's rivers are either direct or tributaries of the Danube. The most important of these rivers are the Mureş River, the Olt River, the Prut, the Siret River, the Ialomiţa River, the Someş River, and the Argeş River.
The rivers of Romania flow either north, south, east, or west away from the Carpathians. Rain and other precipitation help add to the flow of water in each of the rivers and occasionally cause flooding. In the east, the water from the rivers are obtained by the Siret and Prut rivers. In the south, the rivers flow directly into the Danube. In the west, the rivers flow into the Tisza, which is in Hungary.
The Danube is the most important river in Romania. People use it for transportation and to make hydroelectric power from the rivers' flow of water. Boats and other watercraft are able to travel on nearly all of the places that the Danube flows in Romania. A problem that has occurred with using it for transportation is the fact that it is not very close by any of Romania's big industries.
Romania is in the southeastern part of Europe, where it borders the Black Sea and the Danube. The Carpathian mountains lie in the center.
Geographic coordinates:
Extreme points of Romania:
Because of how far it is from the open sea and where it is in the southwestern part of the European continent, Romania has a climate that is changes between temperate and continental climates with four different seasons. The average yearly temperature is 11 °C in the south and 8 °C in the north. The extreme recorded temperatures are 44.5 °C in Ion Sion 1951 and -38.5 °C in Bod 1942.
Rain, snow, and other precipitation is decent with over per year on the highest western mountains. Most of this falls as snow, which gives Romania good skiing. In the south-centern parts of the country, the amount of rain and snow falls to around . In the Danube Delta, not much rain falls. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Romania was -38.5 °C, near Braşov in the year 1944. The highest temperature ever recorded in Romania was 44.5 °C, near Calafat in the 1950s.

Mohenjo-daro

Mohenjo-daro was one of the largest city-settlements of the Indus Valley Civilization of south Asia. 
It is in province of Sindh, Pakistan. The city was built around 2600 BC. It was one of the early urban settlements in the world. Mohenjo-daro existed at the same time as the civilisations of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia and Greece. The archaeological ruins of the city are designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In Pakistan, it is one of the national icons of the distant past.
Mohenjo-daro was built in the 26th century BC. It was one of the largest cities of the ancient Indus Valley Civilization, which developed around 3000 BC from the prehistoric Indus culture. At its height, the Indus Civilization spanned much of what is now Pakistan and North India, extending westwards to the Iranian border, south to Gujarat in India and northwards to an outpost in Bactria. There were major urban centers at Harappa, Mohenjo-daro, Lothal, Kalibangan, Dholavira and Rakhigarhi. 
Mohenjo-daro was the most advanced city of its time, with remarkably sophisticated civil engineering and urban planning. When the Indus civilization went into sudden decline around 1900 BC, Mohenjo-daro was abandoned.
The Dancing girl found in Mohenjo-daro is an artifact that is some 4500 years old. The 10.8 cm long bronze statue of the dancing girl was found in 1926 from a house in Mohenjo-daro. She was British archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler's favorite statuette, as he said in this quote from a 1973 television program:
John Marshall, one of the excavators at Mohenjo-daro, described her as a vivid impression of the young ... "girl, her hand on her hip in a half-impudent posture, and legs slightly forward as she beats time to the music with her legs and feet."
A seated male sculpture is the so-called "Priest King" (even though there is no evidence that either priests or kings ruled the city). Archaeologists discovered the sculpture in Lower town at Mohenjo-daro in 1927. It was found in an unusual house with ornamental brickwork and a wall niche and was lying between brick foundation walls which once held up a floor.
This bearded sculpture wears a fillet around the head, an armband, and a cloak decorated with trefoil patterns that were originally filled with red pigment.

The ancient site at Kot Diji () was the forerunner of the Indus Civilization. The people of this site lived about 3000 BC. The remains consist of two parts; the citadel area on high ground, and the outer area.
Kot Diji is located about 22 kilometres south of Khairpur in the province of Sindh, Pakistan. The site is at the foot of the hills. There a fort (Kot Diji Fort) was built around 1790 by the Talpur ruler of Upper Sindh, Mir Suhrab, who ruled from 1783 to 1830. This fort built on the ridge of a steep narrow hill is well preserved.
Today, Kot Diji is on the way to becoming a more developed area. It has broadband and Wi-Fi internet connections, and all the cellular network service providers are active in the area. Many private and government schools, teaching in English, Urdu, and Hindi, are in Kot Diji. A new shopping centre called "Khazana" has also been built in the city.

Guanaco

The Guanaco ("Lama guanicoe") is camelid animal native to South America. Guanacos are usually found in small herds or loosely structured family groups.
When a member of the herd picks up the slightest hint of danger, it makes a high-pitched warning call, causing the other guanacos to flee swiftly and nimbly across the steep and uneven terrain.
Guanacos generally live at high elevations, grazing on grasses and browsing on leaves and buds.
They can get by without water for long periods of time, obtaining moisture from the plants they eat.

Vicuña

The vicuña ("Vicugna vicugna") is one of two wild South American camelids. The vicuña, the smallest of the camelids, have had an interesting relationship with humans over time.
The overall colour of the soft wooly coat is ochre, light cinnamon, or reddish brown, with the underparts, insides of the legs, and underside of the head being dirty white. On the chest, at the base of the neck, is a peculiar, pompon-like 'mane' of silky white hairs which may be 20-30 cm / 8-12 inches in length. The vicuña is extremely slender, with long skinny limbs and neck. The head is small and wedge shaped, with small, triangular ears. Unique among living even toed-ungulates, the incisors of the vicuña are constantly growing, with enamel on only one side, to keep up with the wear caused by the tough grasses on which they feed.
Grasslands at elevations of 3,500-5,800 meters / 11,700-19,300 feet in the Andes mountains of Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile.

Nocturnes (Debussy)

Nocturnes is a piece of music for orchestra by the French composer Claude Debussy. There are three movements. A female chorus also sings in the last movement. Debussy finished writing "Nocturnes" on 15 December 1899. 
The three movements each have a title. They are:
A large portion of Debussy’s music, including his nocturnes, is inspired by the works of the Impressionist painters. The word nocturne (from the Latin "nocturnus") usually describes a piece that is inspired by the night. However, Debussy's Nocturnes do not follow this patter; rather, they capture the way light is shown in Impressionist paintings.
'Nuages' is about the clouds in the sky and the way they move slowly in grey colours with a little white.
'Fêtes' is a very lively picture of a group of people having a celebration and dancing. A procession is heard arriving. The music of the procession gradually gets louder, mixes with the music of the dancing, then it gradually dies away as the procession disappears into the distance.
'Sirènes' describes the sea and the many rhythms that can be heard when we listen to it. The moonlight shines on the sea, and the mysterious song of the Sirens is heard as they laugh.
The Lamoureux Orchestra conducted by Camille Chevillard gave the first performance of "Nuages" and "Fêtes" in Paris in 1900, and they played the first performance of all three movements the next year. Some of the listeners found it hard to understand at first, but today "Nocturnes" is one of Debussy’s most popular works.
The music lasts for about 22 minutes.

In 2003, the Cavaliers won the NBA Draft lottery, and chose LeBron James with the first pick. James became a star, and the Cavaliers reached the NBA Finals for the first time in 2007. However, they lost to the San Antonio Spurs, 4 games to 0. As of 2011, this is the only time the Cavaliers have made it to the NBA Finals.
James's contract ran out in 2010, and James decided not to sign another contract with the Cavaliers. Instead, he would play for the Miami Heat. The Cavaliers were immediately a worse team. At one point during the 2010-2011 season, they lost 26 games in a row. This set a new NBA record for the most games lost in a row.
After the 2013–14 season, James' contract with the Heat ended, and he decided to return to the Cavaliers. The team, which in the meantime had added rising star Kyrie Irving and would soon add another star in Kevin Love, once again became NBA title contenders. The Cavaliers lost in the 2015 NBA Finals to the Golden State Warriors, and won a rematch against the Warriors in the 2016 Finals. The championship was the first ever for the Cavaliers, and the first for any major sports team in Cleveland in over 50 years.

Freedom of the press

Freedom of the press is a promise by a government not to punish journalists (and other people who report the news) for doing their job. It is an idea like freedom of speech: it lets people express their opinions or beliefs. Many countries have laws or constitutional amendments protecting freedom of the press. The word "press" in the phrase comes from the printing press.
Like with freedom of speech, freedom of the press does not protect everything that a journalist writes. A journalist can be sued for libel, which is publishing false and damaging claims about a person. Publishing copyrighted material is not legal in many countries. Writing about state secrets, like military plans, weapon designs, or other classified information is almost always illegal.

The Establishment Clause does not allow the government to support one religion more than any other religion. The government also can not say a religion or a god is true. This is often described as "separation of church and state", where "state" means "the government". It also does not allow the government to establish a national religion. It allows people to debate religion freely without the federal government of the United States getting involved.

Parliamentary procedure is a commonly accepted way in which a group of people work together to discuss and make decisions. It is a set of rules for meetings.
The term gets its name from its use in the Parliamentary system of government.

The Westminster parliamentary procedures are followed in several Commonwealth countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, and South Africa. In Canada, for example, Parliament uses ["House of Commons Procedure and Practice" as its primary procedural authority.
The rules of the United States Congress were developed from the parliamentary procedures used in Britain. Variations of the American parliamentary procedures are followed in many nations, including Indonesia, the Phillipines, Mexico and South Korea.
In contrast, the procedures of the Diet of Japan have moved away from the British parliamentary model. After the end of World War II, there were efforts to bring Japanese parliamentary procedures more in line with American congressional practices. In Japan, informal negotiations are more important than formal procedures.
In the US, the most widely used set of rules is "Robert's Rules of Order".

Pictures at an Exhibition

Pictures at an Exhibition is a piece of music for solo piano composed by Modest Mussorgsky in 1874. It is Mussorgsky’s most famous solo piano work and often played by virtuosos to show how good they are. Many years after Mussorgsky’s death a French composer named Maurice Ravel made an arrangement of the piece for orchestra. This arrangement has also become very famous and this is how people usually hear the music today.
"Pictures at an Exhibition" is a musical description of an exhibition of pictures by the painter Viktor Hartmann. Hartmann was only 39 when he died in 1873. He and Mussorgsky had been good friends. They both tried to give their works a very Russian character: Hartmann through his pictures and Mussorgsky through his music. In 1874 an exhibition of Hartmann’s pictures was organised in the Academy of Fine Arts in St Petersburg. Mussorgsky went to the exhibition and was inspired to compose his piano piece. 
"Pictures at an Exhibition" describes someone walking round the exhibition and looking at the pictures. The ten pictures he describes in music were drawings and watercolours. Mussorgsky starts his piece with a tune which describes the person walking round the exhibition. It is usually known as the “promenade” theme (a promenade is a walk). At first Mussorgsky puts the promenade theme between each picture, but he does not do that all the way through the piece. Some of the later pictures have bits of the promenade theme in the music.
Mussorgsky composed the piece very quickly, although he was drunk a lot of the time. It was not published until 1886, five years after the composer’s death. The composer’s great friend Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov published it, but he made some changes to what Mussorgsky had written. It was not until 1931 that an edition was published which tried to show exactly what Mussorgsky had written.
Four of the pictures that Mussorgsky described in his music:

<doc id="120999" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=120999" title="Art rock">
Art rock

Art rock (also described as progressive rock or classical rock) is a word that is about a sub-genre of rock music that has "experimental influences". The term 'Art Rock' or 'Kunst Rock' was coined and defined, by the great black philosopher Doctor William Fearon, and is very much related to the 'Kunst Muzik' of the 1970s led by UK/US bands such as the Ramones, Talking Heads and Television and the Detroit/German led Techno movement. Dr Fearon coined the term and its German equivalent in recognition of the impact that Futurism had on late twentieth century music. Far from being an album based music format Art Rock is recognisable at live venues in the modern age, with the developments in light and video technology meaning that Art and Rock can be seamelessly fused. It is an album-based form that is able to have longer, more complex music and lets the musicians spend more time trying different ways to play their instruments. Art rock is not created for mass consumption, meaning it is not made to be liked by most people. It is often long and has a lot of themes like classical music, but usually has more keyboards than guitars. Also, it is not really music to dance to, but music to just listen to, and it often tells a story or has a philosophical theme to the lyrics."
The idea of "art rock" has sometimes been used when talking about the "progressive rock" bands which became popular in the 1970s. Allmusic says that progressive rock and art rock are almost the same; both used to describe rock music that is more artistic. Progressive rock eventually stuck as a label for a specific genre of rock music, while art rock was used to described bands that were harder to label. 
Princeton University's Wordnet dictionary states that "progressive rock, art rock" are "a style of rock music that [came out] in the 1970s; associated with attempts to [mix] rock with jazz and other forms." It also says that it is meant "for listening and not dancing". 
Examples include Queen, The Who, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, David Bowie, The Velvet Underground, The Beatles, Genesis and Yes.

Discography is the study and listing of sound recordings. The word comes from the word "disc", which is the most commonly used term for describing the format used most for sound recordings in the 20th century, and the "-graph" suffix meaning something written.
A listing of all recordings of a musician or singer is usually called their "discography". Discographies may also be created based on a particular musical genre or record label, for example, so that all artists in a genre, or that have contracts with a certain label, are listed together.
The term "discography" became popular in the 1930s by collectors of jazz records. Jazz fans did research and self-published discographies about when jazz records were made and what musicians were on the records, as record companies did not commonly include that information on/with the records at that time.

Progressive metal

Progressive metal (often called prog metal) is a sub-genre of heavy metal music that mixes the powerful, guitar-driven sound of metal with the complexity of progressive rock, which includes odd time signatures and complicated instrumental playing. Some progressive metal bands are also influenced by jazz fusion and classical music. Like progressive rock songs, progressive metal songs are usually much longer than other metal songs, and they are often themed in concept albums. As a result, progressive metal is rarely heard on mainstream radio and video programs.
The origins of progressive metal started with progressive rock bands from the late 1960s and early to mid-1970s such as Yes, Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, King Crimson, Genesis, Kansas and Rush. However, progressive metal did not evolve into a genre of its own until the mid-1980s. Bands such as Queensrÿche, Fates Warning and Dream Theater took certain aspects of progressive rock music and mixed them with heavy metal styles.

Knoxville, Tennessee

Knoxville is the third-largest city in the state of Tennessee, in the United States of America. The largest city in the state is Memphis, followed by Nashville, the capital of Tennessee. Knoxville is the county seat of Knox County. In 2010, it had a population of 178,874.
The city has been often called "The Streaking Capital of the World" and "The Underwear Capital of the World".
Knoxville was founded in 1786 and is the second oldest of Tennessee's four major cities, after Nashville which was founded in 1779. After Tennessee's admission into the Union in 1796, Knoxville was the state's first capital. In 1819, the capital was moved to Murfreesboro, prior to Nashville becoming the current capital. The city was named in honor of the first Secretary of War, Henry Knox.
Knoxville's economy is largely fueled by the regional location of the main campus of the University of Tennessee, the and other Department of Energy facilities in nearby , the National Transportation Research Center, and the Tennessee Valley Authority.
Knoxville's textile and manufacturing industries were hurt by foreign competition in the 1950s and 1960s. After the building of the Interstate Highway system in the 1960s, the railroad—which had been largely responsible for Knoxville's industrial growth—began to decline. Suburban shopping malls in the 1970s took retail revenues away from Knoxville's Downtown area. So, the city sought to recover the massive loss of revenue by trying to annex neighboring communities in Knox County. People fought these annexation attempts. Several efforts to combine all of the Knoxville and Knox County governments failed. But the city and county school boards merged on 1 July 1987.
Knoxville tried to improve its downtown. The 1982 World's Fair—the most successful of these projects—became one of the most popular world's fairs in U.S. history with 11 million visitors. The fair's energy theme was selected due to Knoxville being the headquarters of the Tennessee Valley Authority and for the city's proximity to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The Sunsphere, a steel truss structure topped with a gold-colored glass sphere, was built for the fair and remains one of Knoxville's most prominent buildings, along with the adjacent amphitheater which underwent a renovation that was completed in 2008.
Ever since, Knoxville's downtown has been developing, with the opening of the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame and the Knoxville Convention Center, redevelopment of Market Square, a new visitors center, a regional history museum, a Regal Cinemas theater, several restaurants and bars, and many new and redeveloped condominiums. Since 2000 Knoxville has successfully brought business back to the downtown area. The arts in particular have begun to flourish, there are multiple venues for outdoor concerts. The Tennessee and Bijou Theaters were renovated.
Knoxville has seven sister cities as designated by Sister Cities International:

Così fan tutte

Così fan tutte, ossia La scuola degli amanti ("Women are like that, or The school for lovers") is an "opera buffa" with music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and an Italina libretto by Lorenzo Da Ponte. "Così" premiered at the Burgtheater in Vienna on 26 January 1790. 
Legend says the opera was based on a real-life incident that occurred in Vienna. In the 19th century, the opera was considered somewhat naughty, and was rarely performed. Modern critics however realize the music is some of Mozart's finest, and the opera is now frequently performed around the world. 
The opera is set in Naples in the 18th century. Don Alfonso wagers two young soldiers that their sweethearts will prove unfaithful if given the chance. The men accept the bet. They tell their sweethearts that they have been called to the front and leave Naples.
They return however as turban-clad, moustache-wearing "Albanians" to woo each other's sweetheart. With the conniving of Despina, the two sisters consent to marry the foreigners. At the last moment, the men remove their disguises, and rebuke their faithless sweethearts.

Magazine circulation

A magazine's circulation is the number of copies it usually distributes for each issue. It is one of the main factors used to determine how much money they will charge businesses to advertise in the magazine. is not always the same as copies sold, which is usually called paid circulation, because many magazines are distributed to readers without making them pay anything. This is more true for magazines dealing with business and professional topics. When determining readership figures, which is how many people read an issue, the number is usually considered to be higher than the circulation figures because of the assumption that most copies of the magazine are read by more than one person. In many countries, circulation figures are checked by companies that do not work for the magazine, such as the Audit Bureau of Circulations, to make sure that the numbers a publisher gives to advertisers is accurate.

Paracelsus (11 November or 17 December 1493 in Einsiedeln, Switzerland – 24 September 1541 in Salzburg, Austria) was an alchemist, physician, astrologer, and general occultist. The name "Paracelsus" was a nickname: it means "equal to or greater than Celsus", and refers to his medical skill. He was born Phillip von Hohenheim.
He gained his doctorate degree from the University of Ferrara in 1515 or 1516.
He gave zinc its name (in Latin as "zincum"). He also named the cyanobacterium "Nostoc", which is a long-chain colonial bacterium. The adjective "bombastic" comes from his family name. It refers to his arrogance.
Paracelsus was responsible for the creation of laudanum, an alcoholic herbal opium preparation. It was in common use up to the 19th century. Like most of the alchemists, he was a notable botanist. He wrote various books, but especially his major work (title translated as: "On the miners' sickness and other diseases of miners"). This listed the occupational hazards of metalworking, including treatment and prevention strategies. He also wrote a book on the human body which contradicted Galen's ideas.

The Palos Verdes blue butterfly is a small endangered butterfly that can be seen near the Palos Verdes Peninsula in southwest Los Angeles County, California. So far, it can only be seen here and might be one of the rarest butterflies in the world.
This butterfly has a wingspan of only 25–30 mm. The male has a bright silvery-blue dorsal wing outlined in a narrow line of black, while the female’s dorsal wing is a more brownish-gray color. Both males and females have gray ventral wings with dark spots surrounded by white rings.
"G. lygdamus palosverdesensis" was listed as an endangered species by the Fish and Wildlife Service on July 2, 1980. Insects are not currently protected by California law.
The main threat to the Palos Verdes Blue has been the destruction of their living space by weeds, which has negative effects on the larval foodplants needed.

University of Cambridge

The University of Cambridge (also called Cambridge University) is in Cambridge, England. It is the second-oldest university in all English-speaking countries. It is one of the world's leading places of learning.
The University started as a group of scholars in the city of Cambridge. This may have started in 1209, when scholars left Oxford after a fight with local people. The universities of Oxford and Cambridge are often called "Oxbridge". This is not a different university. It is a way of saying Oxford and Cambridge together. Cambridge University and Oxford University are both very important to the history of England.
Cambridge is usually ranked in the world's top five universities. UK rankings and tests on the quality of its research also rate it very highly. Cambridge has more than 18,000 students and a large number of sport clubs and societies.
Many important people studied at the University of Cambridge, including scientists, poets, artists, politicians and members of the British Royal Family. 89 students from Cambridge later won a Nobel Prize.
The official creation of the University was in 1231, when King Henry III of England gave to the people there the right to teach students and lower taxes. A letter from Pope Gregory IX in 1233 also gave the right to everyone who got a degree from Cambridge to teach in any place in the Christian world.
In 1290 Pope Nicholas IV called Cambridge a "studium generale" (name for a university in Medieval times). From that point many researchers and teachers from other European universities started to come to Cambridge to work or give lessons.
Colleges started as places for students and teachers to live. They were called hostels at first. The students paid money to build and run these hostels. All colleges were formed after the beginning of the University. Over the years, colleges bought all of these hostels back. However, some old names still resist today, such as Garret Hostel Lane which was named after Garret Hostel.
Peterhouse was the first official college to be created in 1284. Many followed over the centuries and today there are 31. The last one, Robinson, was built in the 1970s. Many of these have a chapel because the members should have prayed for the soul of the founders (the people who created the college).
The University was one of the most important places where the Protestant Reformation began. In fact, people started talking about Lutheranism here very early. Thomas Cranmer, who became a central figure for reform, studied at Cambridge.
A century later, some people in Cambridge started to think that the Church of England was too much like the Catholic church. They started the Puritan movement. This produced more than 20,000 people who left for New England around 1620 in search for a place with better religious beliefs. Oliver Cromwell, a very important member of this movement, was a student at Sidney Sussex during this time.
Cambridge has been strong in applied mathematics since Isaac Newton was a student here in the 17th century. Every student had to study maths in order to obtain a degree. The degree was awarded as a "Bachelor of Arts" which mixed both arts and science subjects. Several important early physicists studied at Cambridge. They include James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin and Lord Rayleigh. Pure mathematics was slower to catch up, but Cambridge is still famous for it thanks to people like G.H. Hardy.
Six maths graduates from Cambridge won a Fields Medal and one who got an Abel Prize. These are the world's highest awards for mathematicians. Four other researchers at Cambridge also won Fields Medals.
People at the University of Cambridge have made many important scientific discoveries over the time. These are some of the best known ones:
For many years only men were allowed to study at Cambridge. In 1869 Girton, the first college for women, was built. Women could take exams from 1882, but only in 1948 did they start to be considered full members of the university. For a certain time they even received "ad eundem" degrees (degrees from a University you have not studied at, but you deserve) from the University of Dublin.
Over the years, more women-only colleges were built, until in 1972 Churchill was the first one to become mixed. Many others followed, and in 1988 Magdalene was the last men-only college to open to women. However, there are still some colleges for women only. Cambridge is the only university that still has this characteristic. All other universities in the UK, including Oxford, now have only mixed colleges.
Since it is very old, the University has many legends and traditions. These are often passed on by older students to the younger ones. Tour guides also tell these stories to tourists.
The wooden spoon tradition was to give this type of spoon to the student who was the worst in the year for mathematics but still passed the exams. This was because the students used to be ranked in order of their result. After 1909 this was changed and so the wooden spoon cannot be given anymore. However, still today in many sport competitions a wooden spoon is given to the last person in the rankings.
Many legends exist about places in Cambridge. For example, there is a story about the "Mathematical Bridge" in Queen's College. Newton built it without using any bolts or screws. Some people then took it down to see how it was made. When they tried to put it up again they could not do it, so they had to insert many bolts.
Another tradition is that the King's College choir sings the Nine Lessons and Carols church service. This is recorded by the BBC and sent around the world since 1928 by radio. From 1954 it can also be seen on television. Many people watch it on Christmas Eve in Great Britain.
The University of Cambridge is a "collegiate" university. This means it is divided into the colleges, and every student and teacher joins one college only. Every one of these colleges has its own property and money. They all have many Fellows who can teach all the subjects between them. Then there are Departments and Faculties, which are buildings where only one subject is studied. There are also Schools that bring different Departments and Faculties together. The overall head of the University is called the Vice-Chancellor. They are head of the Senate and Regent House which make decisions for the whole University.
There are 31 colleges in Cambridge:
<nowiki>*</nowiki>Only for women
†Only for PhD studends
‡Only for students older than 21 years
There are also 3 smaller affiliated colleges: Westcott House, Westminster College and Ridley Hall. These are not real colleges, but students there can follow the University of Cambridge's lessons. They are only for theology, the study of religion. These three colleges together form the "Cambridge Theological Federation".
The teaching is done through lectures and practical classes (where students do experiments in science subjects) organized by the Department. The colleges also organize supervisions. These are small lessons in groups of 2 or 3: the students do some homework and then talk about it with a teacher. This is often considered to be one of the best things about studying at Cambridge. The teaching is very personal and students have the chance to ask lots of questions and really understand the subject.
There are more than 150 different faculties and departments in Cambridge. These are then grouped into "Schools". These have a supervisory body, a group of people who check that the departments are doing ok. There are six Schools:
The year is divided into three parts. The first one is Michaelmas Term, which is from October to December and takes its name from St Michael's day and Christmas. The second one is Lent Term, and goes from January to March. The last one is Easter Term, from April to June. Within these times, there is a period of 8 weeks called "Full Term". Most lessons and exams happen in Full Term. All students need to live in college for this period. There is a University rule which says that students can get their degree only if they have stayed for at least 9 terms (3 years) at a distance of less than 10 miles from the main Church in Cambridge.
The head of the University is the Chancellor. As of 2013, he is David Sainsbury. He was elected in 2011 after Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh said he did not want to do it anymore. Prince Philip had been Chancellor for 25 years. The position of Chancellor is mainly ceremonial. That means that the Chancellor does not take part in many decisions. He is just there because an overall head of the University is needed.
The Vice-Chancellor instead is the one that makes most decisions. For example, he/she approves and signs new rules. The role is given to a person for at least five years. The current Vice-Chancellor is Leszek Borysiewicz.
The Senate House is a building in Cambridge. The degree ceremony takes place there. Any Cambridge student who has an MA degree is a member of the Senate. It is also the place where the important people in the University meet to take decisions. These important people are different Officers and Fellows of the colleges. They are also called the "Regent House". This is not another building, it is just a way of calling these people. They can make and change rules when they meet. News and information are printed and given out in the "Cambridge University Reporter". This is the official newspaper of the university.
The university had £4.3 billion in endowments in 2011. This money was given over lots of time by many people. This is the biggest amount of money for universities in Europe. Every college controls its money on its own. They are all considered charitable organizations. The British Government also gives money in research grants: these are for postgraduate students and their teachers. There is also some income produced by the Cambridge University Press.
In 2000, Cambridge received a very large donation of US$210 million from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. This was to set up a scholarship so that US and other international students could study in Cambridge more easily. Bill Gates was also made a Knight by the Queen because of his generosity. Between 2005 and 2012, a campaign was made to get £1 billion from old students. This was at the same time of the University's 800th anniversary. The campaign got to the target early in 2010.
The University is spread around the town of Cambridge. The older colleges are on the river Cam. The departments and faculties are spread in different places, usually grouped in sites. There are nine main sites:
Addenbrooke's Hospital is where the medicine students go to learn how to cure patients. The "Judge Business School" is another important building: this is where courses about business and finance are taught. Since the different sites are quite close to each other, many students like to use the bicycle to move around. A fifth of the journeys in the town is made by bike. Students are also not allowed to drive a car while they are in Cambridge.
Local people from Cambridge don't always like the students. "Town and Gown" is a phrase to talk about this relationship. "Town" means the Cambridge locals while "Gown" means the students and teachers, from the type of dress they wear. Since the University began, there have been some fights between the two groups. In 1381, many things were stolen from the university and the colleges. The Chancellor was then given extra power to control order in the town. When the plague arrived in Cambridge in 1630, many colleges closed up. They did not want to help the locals who had the disease.
However, more recently there have been fewer fights. The University also means more jobs and money for the population. There are many small industries that were created in Cambridge because the University was near. This effect is called "The Cambridge Phenomenon". Between 1960-2010 there have been 1,500 new companies and 40,000 new jobs in Cambridge just thanks to the University.
The University has 114 libraries. The main one is called "Cambridge University Library". It is a legal deposit, which means every book that is printed in the United Kingdom goes in this library. Many departments have their own library as well. They usually have special books for their subjects only. All colleges have a library. This is mainly for the undergraduates, so that they can read basic books about their subjects. Some colleges also have very precious books and manuscripts. For example, the Parker Library (Corpus Christi College) has special books from Medieval times.
The university also has 8 museums and a botanical garden:
One of the main aims of the University of Cambridge is to do scientific research. All the departments are always studying and discovering new things. Many important people have done research in Cambridge. This is because the university has a lot of money and resources like laboratories and books. It had £283.7 M in 2011 to spend on research; this was mainly given by the UK Government and the European Commission.
Students need to pass some tests and interviews to be allowed in Cambridge. For undergraduates, the application is done through UCAS. This is as with any other university in the UK. Students need to be very good to enter Cambridge. If they study A-levels, they are asked to get at least A*AA. Because many good students apply, the interview is very important to choose the best ones. These are done by Fellows. Usually about 25% of the applicants get a place. However, the number changes depending on the subjects. Some of them, like medicine and economics are very hard to get into. Students need to choose a college before doing the application. They may later have to change it if the college thinks they are good but does not have enough places for them.
For postgraduates the application is different. They need to ask professors (teachers) in the departments they want to work in. After an interview, they can be given a place. They then have to get some funding (money to do the project). This can be given from a government or another institution.
Some people think that admission at Cambridge is not very fair. This is because it is easier to get in if you go to a private school instead of a state school. In 2007-2008, only 57% of students who got a place were coming from state school. However, about 93% of British children go to them. If a student goes to a private school, he/she is also more likely to get a place after the interview. In 2011, only 25% of students that applied from state school got a place, while the percentage was 33% for private school students. The University is trying to make things better by making the admission process easier and giving scholarships for the poorer students. Another problem is that year after year there are also fewer people from state schools applying.
Cambridge does very well when the quality of research is tested. In 2001, it was ranked first in the British Government Assessment Exercise. Cambridge also gives out more PhDs in a year than any other UK university.
The following table has Cambridge results over the years in various College and university rankings.
The colleges also have a ranking between them. This is called the "Tompkins Table". It is published every year by The Independent newspaper. Trinity College and Emmanuel College usually do very well in it.
The University also runs many public examinations. This can be for people who want to take language tests in English for example. Some of the A-level and GCSEs exams are also written and organized here.
The University of Cambridge is a member of
It is also considered part of the "Golden Triangle", a geographical concentration of UK university research.
The "Cambridge University Students' Union" (CUSU) represents all the students within the University. All new students become members when they arrive in Cambridge. It was started in 1964 as the "Students' Representative Council" (SRC). There are six important positions in the Union which are taken by students who take a year off work. These people have meetings with the Vice-Chancellor and other university officers to talk about new rules or how to change them.
Inside the colleges, there are also group of students who represent all of the others. These are called JCR (Junior Common Room) for undergraduates and MCR (Middle Common Room) for postgraduates. They organize things like "Fresher's Week", the first week in October when new first-year students arrive. They also make sure every student is happy about his life in Cambridge.
Sport has always been very important in Cambridge. Many students try rowing because the Cam river is a good one to play this sport. There are many boat races between the different colleges. These are called "bumps": because the river is too small, boats start one behind the other. To win, a boat needs to hit (or "bump") the one ahead. Every year in London there is also the famous Boat Race between Oxford and Cambridge. Many other sports are played between colleges and universities.
Places to do sports, like gyms and fields, are run by the single colleges. A new University-wide sports complex is being built.
Cambridge is also full of societies: these are small groups of people that meet together to do something that they like. These can be speaking a language, playing chess, acting in theatres, playing a musical instrument. In 2010, there were 751 societies. There can also be smaller clubs in the colleges.
There are three student newspapers, that tell things that happen around the university. "Varsity", created in 1947, is the oldest one. "The Cambridge Student" and "The Tab" are newer ones; "The Tab" has funny articles and is less serious. There is also a radio station called "Cam FM". This is run with help from Anglia Ruskin University, which is another university in Cambridge.
"Formal Halls" are special dinners where students and Fellows eat together. Everyone wears a suit and there is good food. There is a prayer in Latin at the beginning and at the end. These dinners are a tradition and the idea is that people in the college should get to know each other at them. After the exams, there is "May Week" when students make parties. A "May Ball" happens in every college: it lasts all night and there is lots of music and food.
Many people who later became very famous in their subject studied at Cambridge. 89 people linked with Cambridge have won a Nobel Prize. This includes 29 prizes in physics, 26 in medicine, 21 in chemistry and 9 in economics. People from Cambridge have also done great things in the arts and sports.
Cambridge has a very strong tradition in this field. Students include Isaac Newton, who made lots of experiments in Trinity College. Francis Bacon developed the Scientific method which is the starting point of today's science. G. H. Hardy and Srinivasa Ramanujan did a lot in pure mathematics. James Clerk Maxwell found out more about electromagnetism. In biology, Charles Darwin made his theory about natural selection while Francis Crick and James D. Watson discovered the structure of DNA. Also David Attenborough, who is now a television presenter, was a science student at Cambridge.
In nuclear physics, the discoveries of Ernest Rutherford, Niels Bohr, J. J. Thomson and James Chadwick made people really understand what is inside an atom: electrons, protons and neutrons. J. Robert Oppenheimer studied here and later went on to develop the atomic bomb. In astronomy, Paul Dirac, Stephen Hawking, John Herschel and Georges Lemaître found out many things about the universe, from the Big Bang to black holes.
Desiderius Erasmus was really important for starting studies about Greek and Latin at the University. In economics, John Maynard Keynes, Thomas Robert Malthus and Milton Friedman all started their theories in Cambridge. Known philosophers are Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, George Santayana, Karl Popper and Muhammad Iqbal. Many Archbishops of Canterbury also studied at Cambridge, like Rowan Williams. William Wilberforce helped to stop the slave trade. Thomas Cranmer was an Archbishop who was then killed because of his ideas.
In music, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Charles Villiers Stanford, William Sterndale Bennett, Orlando Gibbons and more recently John Rutter all started their education at Cambridge. Some members of the band Radiohead were also here. In the arts, Quentin Blake was an undergraduate here.
Students in this field include Christopher Marlowe, writer of many tragedies; Samuel Pepys, after who the library in Magdalene College is called; William Makepeace Thackeray, famous for his satire; E. M. Forster, a more contemporary author and C. S. Lewis, fantasy writer. Virginia Woolf did not study here but based her books around the colleges. Poets include Edmund Spenser, John Donne, John Milton, John Dryden, Lord Byron and Samuel Taylor Coleridge who started the Romantic movement.
Known actors and directors are Ian McKellen, Derek Jacobi, Michael Redgrave, James Mason, Emma Thompson, Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Graham Chapman, Tilda Swinton, Thandie Newton, Rachel Weisz, Sacha Baron Cohen, Tom Hiddleston all studied at the university.
More than 50 people who won medals at the Olympic Games had studied in Cambridge, as George Mallory did, who might have been the first to reach the top of mount Everest.
Finally, Cambridge is also strong in politics because it educated:
Due to its long history, the University has been named in many books and works by different authors.

In June 2004, police numbers in Scotland were 15,714. By the end of June 2012, police numbers had risen to 17,373. This shows a 10.56& increase in police numbers over this 8 year period.
The Royal Ulster Constabulary was formed in 1922 to police the new Northern Ireland. It was renamed in 2001 following the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 undertaken by the Patten Commission.
In Northern Ireland, police powers have not been transferred to the Northern Ireland Executive as they have been in Scotland, instead they remain with the Northern Ireland Office in the UK Government. 
In April 2007 police numbers in Northern Ireland were:
The Police Service of Northern Ireland does not employ Police Community Support Officers.

The Chenab River (, IAST: canāb, , literally: 'Moon(Chan) چن River(aab)') آب is formed by the confluence of the Chandra and Bhaga rivers at Tandi in the upper Himalayas in the Lahul and Spiti District of Himachal Pradesh, Republic of India. In its upper reaches it is also known as the Chandrabhaga. It is a tributary of the Indus River.
It flows through the Jammu region of Jammu and Kashmir into the plains of the Punjab, forming the boundary between the Rechna and Jech interfluves (Doabs in Persian). It is joined by the Jhelum River at Trimmu تریمو and then by the Ravi River Ahmadpur Siyaal احمدپورسیال. It then merges with the Sutlej River near Uch Sharif to form the Panjnad or the 'Five Rivers', the fifth being the Beas River which joins the Satluj near Ferozepur, India. The Chenab then joins the Indus at Mithankot. The total length of the Chenab is about 960 kilometres. 
The waters of the Chenab are allocated to Pakistan under the terms of the Indus Waters Treaty.
The Baglihar hydropower dam is being built (as of 2006) on the Chenab River in the Doda district. This is about 110 kilometers eastward of the Pakistan border in the Jammu division of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. The dam is one of 9 hydro-electric projects on the Chenab River.

The river Jhelum rises from a spring at Verinag situated at the foot of the Pir Panjal in the south-eastern part of the valley of Kashmir. It flows through Srinagar and the Wular Lake before entering Pakistan from Kashmir through a deep narrow gorge. The Kishenganga Neelum River, the largest tributary of the Jhelum, joins it near Muzaffarabad, as does the next largest, the Kunhar River of the Kaghan valley. It also connects with Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir on Kohala Bridge east of Circle Bakote. It is then joined by the Poonch river, and flows into the Mangla reservoir in the Mirpur District. The Jhelum enters the Punjab in the Jhelum District. From there, it flows through the plains of Pakistan's Punjab, forming the boundary between the Chaj and Sindh Sagar Doabs. It ends in a confluence with the Chenab at Trimmu in District Jhang. The Chenab merges with the Sutlej to form the Panjnad River which joins the Indus River at Mithankot.

Polly Pocket

Polly Pocket is a line of small plastic dolls and accessories. The name comes from the fact that many of the first Polly Pocket toys came in pocket-size cases. The Fashion Polly dolls are sold by Mattel.
Polly was first designed by Chris Wiggs in 1983 for his daughter Kate. Using a powder compact, he created a small house for the very small doll. Bluebird Toys of Swindon, England licensed the idea. The first Polly Pocket were sold in stores in 1989. Mattel held a distribution agreement with Bluebird Toys for Polly Pocket items in the early 1990s. In 1998, while production slowed, several companies tried to buy Bluebird Toys. Mattel finally bought the company later that year. 
In 1999, Mattel changed the design of Polly. They created a new series of collectible items. The new Polly doll is larger. It also looks more similar to a real person than the first dolls. That same year, Mattel also started selling Fashion Polly!. This line used the same characters from the new Polly Pocket (Polly, Lea, Shani, Lila, etc.) but they were 3 ¾ inch (9.5 cm) plastic jointed dolls. Instead of the normal cloth clothing, Polly Pockets used "Polly Stretch" clothing. These were rubbery plastic clothes that could be put on the dolls and removed. They also created boy dolls.

Shyok River

The Shyok River is a river flowing through Disputed Area Ladakh and the Northern Areas of Pakistan (Ghanche District). Shyok river (a tributary of the Indus) originates from the Rimo glacier, one of the tongues of Siachen Glacier and becomes very wide at the confluence with the Nubra River (a tributary of Shyok, originating from Siachen Glacier). 
The alignment of the Shyok river is very unusual, originating from the Rimo glacier it flows in a SE direction and at joining the Pangong range it takes a NW turn and flows parallel to its previous path. The Shyok flowing in a wide valley suddenly enters a narrow gorge after Chalunka and then joins the Indus at Skardu (Pakistan). The Nubra river originating from the Siachen glacier also behaves like the Shyok, before Tirit the SE flowing river takes a NW turn on meeting the river Shyok. The similarity in the courses of these two important rivers probably indicates a series of palaeo fault lines trending NW-SE in delimiting the upper courses of the rivers. The importance of the Indus River and the Shyok rivers is in the deposition of a huge thickness of Quaternary sediments a treasure trove for geology researchers.

Wisent

The wisent (or the European bison, "Bison bonasus") is a bison species and the heaviest surviving animal in Europe. It is a close relative of the American bison.
Longer legged and less heavily built than its American cousin, the wisent may reach a height of 54 to 60 in. (137–152 cm) at the shoulder, and a weight of more than 1 ton (900 kg). It has brown hair and short upcurved horns. Its hump is less prominent than that of the American bison and its coat less shaggy.
In the wild the wisent is a forest animal; it browses on leaves, ferns, and bark. Females give birth after a gestation period of 9 to 10 months, usually to a single calf. Abundant in Europe in prehistoric times, wisents remained numerous until the early Christian era.
Hunted for their meat and displaced from their habitats by farmers, by the 11th cent. they had been reduced to herds numbering but a few hundred animals. By 1927 fewer than 50 remained. Since the foundation of an international protective society in 1932, their numbers have been growing, but they are no longer found outside zoos or forest reserves.

Panjnad River (, Sanskrit: panj = five, nadi = river) is a river in Punjab, Pakistan. Panjnad River is formed by successive confluence of the five rivers of Punjab, namely Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas and Sutlej. Jhelum and Ravi join Chenab, Beas joins Sutlej, and then Sutlej and Chenab join to form Panjnad near Uch Sharif. The combined stream runs southwest for approximately 45 miles and joins Indus River at Mithankot. The Indus continues into the Arabian Sea. A dam on Panjnad has been erected; it provides irrigation channels for Punjab and Sind provinces south of the Sutlej and east of the Indus rivers.
Beyond the meeting of Indus and Panjnad rivers, the Indus river was known as Satnad (Sat = seven) carrying the waters of seven rivers including Indus river, which is believed to be in ealrlier times the Saraswati River/Ghaggar-Hakra River river which eventually dried and became a seasonal river due to seismic shifts in the glacial region of Himachal Pradesh where it originated and later on Kabul river and the five rivers of Punjab.

It passes through the cities of Kabul, Chaharbagh, Jalalabad, and (flowing into Pakistan some 30 km north of the Khyber Pass) Nowshera. The major tributaries of the Kabul River are the Logar, Panjshir, Kunar and Alingar and Bara rivers.
The Kabul river itself is little more than a trickle for most of the year, but swells in summer due to melting snows. Its largest tributary is the Kunar River, which starts out as the Mastuj River, flowing from the Chiantar glacier in Chitral, Pakistan and once it flows south into Afghanistan it is met by the Bashgal river flowing from Nurestan. The Kunar meets the Kabul near Jalalabad. In spite of the Kunar carrying more water than the Kabul, the river continues as the Kabul River after this confluence, mainly for the political and historical significance of the name.

Soan River

The Soan River () is a river in Punjab, Pakistan. It is the most important stream of the Pothohar region. It drains much of the water of Pothohar. It also forms the northern border of Bannu District.
The river starts near a small village Bun in the foothills of Patriata and Murree. It provides water to Simblee Dam, which is reservoir of water for Islamabad. Near Pharwala Fort it cuts through a high mountain range and that is a wonderful phenomenon of nature. The place is called Swan Cut. No stream can cut such a high mountain. It proves the Swaan was there before the formation of this range. And when the mountain rose through millions of years, the stream continued its path by cutting the rising mountain. Ling stream, following a relatively long course though Lehtrar and Kahuta falls in the Swaan near Sihala.
Islamabad Highway crosses this stream near Sihala where famous bridge Cock Pull is constructed over it. Another famous, Lai stream joins this stream near Swaan Camp. After walking a tortuous path and creating a big curve, the stream reaches Kalabagh where it falls into the Indus river. This relatively small stream is more than 250 kilometers long. Due to its mountainous course and shallow bed, it is hardly used for irrigation purposes. For grinding wheat, you can find ancient types of flour mills near Chakian. Fishing is not possible in this stream as a profession. Rohu is the main species of fish in this stream. Kingfisher birds hunt here too.

The Fox and the Hound 2

The Fox and the Hound 2 is a 2006 direct-to-video midquel to the 1981 Disney animated movie"The Fox and the Hound". It was produced by DisneyToon Studios, directed by Jim Kammerud, and features the voice talents of Patrick Swayze and Reba McEntire. The story takes place during the youth of Tod and Copper, in which Copper is tempted to join a band of singing stray dogs. The movie was released on December 12, 2006, rated G by the MPAA, and had an official soundtrack album released on November 21, 2006.
Best friends Tod, a fox kit, (Jonah Bobo) and Copper, a hound puppy, (Harrison Fahn) visit a country fair when they see a band of dogs called "The Singin' Strays". The band has five members: Dixie (Reba McEntire), Cash (Patrick Swayze), Granny Rose (Vicki Lawrence), and twin brothers Waylon and Floyd (both Jim Cummings). It is important that they perform well because a talent scout from the Grand Ole Opry will be at the fair. 
Cash and Dixie get into an argument, and Dixie walks off before their performance, forcing them to go on stage without her. During the show Copper sings along, and Cash invites the pup up on stage to sing with them. The musical number is a success. Cash invites Copper to join the band, which he does upon promising that he is a "stray". Copper spends the entire day with Cash, forgetting his promise to watch fireworks with Tod. Dixie finds Tod and sympathizes with his feelings of abandonment. During their conversation, Tod lets it slip that Copper is not a stray, and Dixie hatches a plan to get Copper out of the band with Tod's help.
Tod lures Copper's owner, Slade, to the fair in a wild chase. The chase leads to widespread mayhem in the fair, and the Singin' Strays' performance is sabotaged right in front of the talent scout Mr. Bickerstaff. Copper is fired from the band and returns home with Slade. Tod is sorry for ruining everything, and is brought home by Widow Tweed. Along the way, Tweed narrowly misses being hit by the talent scout's car, and Bickerstaff's hat flies off and lands on Tod.
The following day, Tod and Copper admit their mistakes and are friends again. Hoping to amend for his doings, Tod gives Bickerstaff's hat to Copper, who uses it to track down the talent scout at a local diner. Tod tricks Cash and Dixie into thinking the other is in trouble, and the entire band end up meeting up at the diner. Copper convinces the band the importance of harmony, and The Singin' Strays howl a reprise of their song "We're in Harmony," attracting the attention of the talent scout. Impressed with the band, he arranges for the dogs to perform at the Grand Ole Opry. The movie ends with Copper choosing to leave the band and play with Tod again.

Direct-to-video

A movie that is released direct-to-video (also known as made-for-video, straight-to-video, more recently, straight-to-DVD) is one which has been released to the public on home video formats (historically VHS) before or without being released in movie theaters or broadcast on television. The term is also at times used as an insulting term for sequels of movies that are not expected to have financial success.
Direct-to-video releases can occur for several reasons. Often a production studio will develop a TV show or movie which is not generally released for several possible reasons: poor quality, lack of support from a TV network, controversial nature, or a simple lack of general public interest. Studios, limited in the annual number of movies they grant cinematic releases to, may choose to pull the completed movie from the theaters, or never exhibit it in theaters at all. Studios then recover some of their losses through video sales and rentals.
In the case of a TV show, low ratings may cause a studio to cancel the show, possibly after having filmed an entire season and aired some episodes. If the show has a considerable fanbase, the studio may release unaired episodes on video to recover losses. "" and "Firefly" are examples of canceled shows which were successful cult hits on DVD. Occasionally outstanding DVD sales may revive a canceled show, as in the case of "Family Guy".Originally canceled in 2004,the series was revived in 2005 due partly to its excellent DVD sales.
Direct-to-video releases have historically carried a stigma of lower technical or artistic quality than theatrical releases. Some studio movies released direct-to-video are movies which have been completed but were never released. This delay often occurs when a studio doubts a movie's commercial prospects would justify a full cinema release, or because its "release window" has closed. A release window refers to a timely trend or personality, and missing that window of opportunity means a movie, possibly rushed into production, failed to release before the trend faded. In movie industry slang such movies are referred to as having been "vaulted."
There is a positive side to direct-to-video releases. They have become something of a lifeline for independent filmmakers and smaller companies.
Direct-to-video releases can be done for movies which cannot be shown theatrically due to controversial content, or because the cost involved in a theatrical release is beyond the releasing company. Almost all pornographic movies are released direct-to-video.
Animated sequels and movie-length episodes of animated series are also often released in this fashion. The Walt Disney Company began making sequels of most of its animated movies for video release beginning with "The Return of Jafar" (the sequel to "Aladdin") in 1994. Universal Studios also began their long line of "The Land Before Time" sequels that same year. In 2005, Fox released "" for DVD and Universal Media Disc.
Once in a while, a studio that makes a movie that was prepared as a direct-to-video movie and release it theatrically at the last minute due to the success of another movie with a similar subject matter or an ultimate studio decision. "Doug's 1st Movie" is an example of this, quickly changed from a DTV to a theatrical release due to the surprise success of "The Rugrats Movie".
Television spin-offs are animated or live action television series or made for TV movies which contain either characters or theme elements from an older series or movie (Clerks: The Animated Series, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventures). While the most common examples of a television spin off are animated series there are also live action examples (Robocop: Prime Directive)
Some "SpongeBob SquarePants" DVD volumes contain episodes not yet aired in the United States. Certain special episodes of Pokémon were released directly on video such as Pikachu’s Winter Vacation. Some Disney Channel shows, such as "That's So Raven", "The Suite Life of Zack and Cody", "Phil of the Future", and "" have also had direct-to-video episodes.
As the DVD format supplants the videocassette, companies have increasingly released movies in DVD format rather than VHS, causing the term "direct-to-DVD" to replace "direct-to-video" in some instances. However, the word "video" does not necessarily refer to VHS cassettes. The new term used is DVDP ("DVD Premiere"). Such movies can cost as much as $20 million (about a third of the average cost of a Hollywood release) and feature actors like Jean-Claude Van Damme and Steven Seagal. Salaries for such actors range from $2 to $4 million (Van Damme) to $4.5 to $10 million (Seagal). According to "Variety", "" sold a million copies in one week, despite retaining only two actors from the original trilogy.
In recent years, DVD Premieres have become a substantial source of revenue for movie studios. DVDPs have collectively grossed over $3 billion over the last few years, and have matured enough that DVDP divisions of studios now option their own movies. Studios realized that DVDP movies can be shot on a smaller budget, thus allowing studios larger profits with the combined revenues of home video sales and rentals, in addition to licensing movies for television and for distribution abroad (where some DVDP movies do see theatrical releases).
Distributing DVDPs is not a practice reserved solely for larger Hollywood studios. Several companies, such as The Asylum, MTI Home Video, and York Entertainment distribute DVDPs almost exclusively. The budgets for movies distributed by these companies are even smaller than those of ones distributed by a larger studio, but these companies are still able to profit off their sales.
In Japan, the direct-to-video movement carries different connotations, being a niche product rather than a fallback medium. Despite having lower budgets than features intended for theater release, Japanese direct-to-video productions are rarely marred by the poor storyline and lower quality production often associated with the DTV market in the US. So-called V-Cinema has more respect from the public, and affection from movie directors for the greater creative freedoms the medium allows. DTV releases are subject to fewer restrictions.
In the case of anime, this is called Original Video Animation (OVA or OAV), and their production values usually fall between those of television series and movies. They are often used to tell stories too short to fill a full TV season, and were particularly common in the early 1990s. Sometimes OVAs garner enough interest to justify commissioning a full television series, like "Tenchi Muyo!", "One Piece", and "El Hazard".
With the advent of the 13 episode season format, OVAs are less common now. The majority of OVAs released in today's market are usually continuations or reworkings of recently completed TV series. For instance, the DVD release of a TV series might include a bonus episode that was never broadcast as a sales hook.

One of the dalmatians, Patch, feels lost in a sea of spots and wants to be a one-of-a-kind wonder dog like his TV hero, Thunderbolt. While watching the Thunderbolt Adventure Hour, Patch hears about a chance to appear on the show while it's filming in London. However, the family move will cause a problem for Patch's opportunity. However, he is accidentally left behind in the commotion. Patch heads for the audition to meet his hero and find out if he one of a kind, or just one of 101.
Meanwhile, Thunderbolt's "trusty" sidekick, Lil' Lightning, tells Thunderbolt the producers want to replace him with a younger dog. In order to save his job, Thunderbolt decides he will go into the real world and perform an act of true heroism to prove himself. A relible reference book to Thunderbolt's many adventures, Patch provides the perfect guide for the TV star in his attempts at real-life heroics. As for Cruella - she's back and more obsessed with Dalmatians than ever. At first, an artist named Lars can calm her down, but he cannot make the perfect spot painting, so she locks him up and returns to her old ways. Lil 'lightning tells Thunderbolt and Patch that Thunderbolt was not going to be replaced but it is just a trick to make him quit once and for all and make Lightning the star. Patch becomes heartbroken when he finds out that his favorite wonderdog just a TV actor.

Troy

Troy was a city in north-west Asia Minor. It was the center of the Trojan War, as told in eight long epic poems, six from the Epic Cycle, and two written by Homer, the "Iliad" and the "Odyssey".
Today it is the name of an archaeological site, the location of Homeric Troy, in Hisarlik in Anatolia, close to the seacoast in what is now Çanakkale province in northwest Turkey, southwest of the Dardanelles.
UNESCO has listed the archaeological site of Troy as a World Heritage Site.
Troy as seen in Homer's account is probably true in part. However, it is wrong to think his account is historically exact. With that warning, this is a summary of events leading up to the Trojan war, mostly derived from the Iliad. 
Troy was a powerful kingdom in the Mediterranean sea, and thrived under the long rule of King Priam. His many sons, including the valiant, strong, unbeatable Hector, and Paris, a creative character who was not a strong fighter but a passionate man, are the best known in the Troy myth. 
In Greece lay a Kingdom called Mycene, owned by Mycenaean or Mykene people, ruled by King Agamemnon. He started a campaign to pressure the Greece cities or kingdoms and to join him and attack Troy, to capture its many riches. The King of Ithaca, Odysseus (or "Ulysses", as he was also known), along with King Idomenous of Crete, with up to 22 more Kingdoms and Kings, spent ten years attacking Troy. Eventually, Troy fell after a coup that Odysseus had thought up, using a wooden trojan horse to hide soldiers within in order to get soldiers behind the Trojan line of defence.
Before the fall of Troy, during the dawn of the War, King Priam sought to create an alliance with the strong Kingdom of Sparta in Northern Greece, to defend Troy when the war had begun. King Aeneas, or Helikaon as he was said to be known, King of Dardanos, was a good friend of Hektor and King Priam, and sided with the Trojans in the war. Unfortunately, on the journey back, after Hektor and Paris had forged an alliance in Sparta, Paris took the wife of the King of Sparta, Princess Helen, without his consent, as they had fallen in love. This ended the alliance,and Sparta eventually joined the fighting cause of King Agammenon.

Undertow is Tool's first full-length album, released in 1993. When this album was released, grunge music was at its most popular, and pop punk was slowly beginning to become popular. "Undertow" helped heavy metal music continue as a leading mainstream musical style, and allowed several later bands to break through to the mainstream. Allmusic saw the album's success in the "striking, haunting visuals that complemented the album's nihilistic yet wistful mood." It was eventually certified double platinum by the RIAA on May 14, 2001.
The album was recorded between October and December 1992 at Grand Master Studios, Hollywood, California, and includes songs that the band decided to not release on their previous EP, "Opiate".

Trumpet Concerto (Arutunian)

Arutunian Trumpet Concerto is Armenian composer Alexander Arutunian’s sixth major composition. It was written for the Soviet trumpet player Timofei Dokschitzer, who moved to the USA and represented the concerto there. According to J. Sundram, "it is an energetic powerhouse of Eastern European lyricism and harmonic textures". According to Philip Smith, the principal trumpet of the New York Philharmonic, Arutunian's Trumpet Concerto is too much popular among the trumpet players.
Arutiunian's Trumpet Concerto consists of the following movements:
Conductor: Pekka Savidtsuki. Finland 
The London Symphony orchestra. Conductor: Luis Has. RCA Victor 09026-62661-2. USA, 1994 
Conductor: Konstantin Orbelyan, Jr. CHAN 9668 England, 2000

Alexander Arutunian

Alexander Arutiunian (born September 23, 1920, Yerevan; died March 28, 2012) was an Armenian composer and pianist, widely-known particularly for his Trumpet concerto. He was awarded by the State Prizes of USSR (1949) and Armenia (1970), People's Artist of the USSR (1970) and Armenian SSR (1964) honorary titles, "St Mesrop Mashtots" and "Khorenatsi" Armenian medals, "Alexandrov" Gold medal (1976), "St Sahak and St Mesrop" Order by Holy Etchmiadzin (2004).
He graduated from the Music Conservatory of Yerevan, then he studied composition with Genrikh Litinsky. After graduation he returned to Yerevan to teach at the local Conservatory and later he became artistic director of the Armenian Philarmonic Orchestra.
In 1948 he was awarded the USSR State Prize for the "Motherland" cantata, a graduation piece he wrote as a student at the Moscow Conservatory. He has continued to win acclaim at home and abroad for his works, many of which are quickened by the folk traditions of Armenian music.
Some of Arutiunian's works for wind instruments, notably the 1950 concerto for trumpet, the concerto for tuba, and the brass quintet "Armenian Scenes", have secured their place in the international repertory, having been performed by conductors such as Valeri Gergiev, who has recorded his Symphony for large orchestra, composed in 1957 with the Symphony orchestra of the Russian All-Union Radio. In 1988, he composed his Violin Concerto "Armenia-88".

Epicurus

Epicurus (Samos, 341 BC – Athens, 270 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher. He started a school of philosophy called Epicureanism. 
As a boy he studied philosophy under the Platonist teacher Pamphilus for about four years. At the age of 18 he went to Athens for his two-year term of military service. Epicurus never married and had no children, so far as we know.
Epicurus helped in the development of science and the scientific method because he said that nothing should be believed except what we can test through direct observation and logical deduction. His ideas about nature and physics hinted at scientific concepts developed in modern times.
Epicurus' only surviving complete works are three letters, which can be found in book X of Diogenes Laertius' "Lives of Eminent Philosophers", and two groups of quotes: the "Principal Doctrines", reported as well in Diogenes' book X, and the "Vatican Sayings", preserved in a manuscript from the Vatican Library.
Many pieces of his thirty-seven volume treatise "On Nature" have been found in the burnt papyrus fragments at the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum.

<doc id="121286" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=121286" title="Coulomb's law">
Coulomb's law

Coulomb's law is a function developed in the 1780s by physicist Charles Augustin de Coulomb. It explains how strong the force will be between two electrostatic charges. Electrostatic means electric charges without any motion.
Let's think of two electric charges existing in an empty space. If the two charges are opposite, (+) and (-) charges for example, they will attract each other. And if two charges are both the same, both (+) or both (-) for example, they will push each other. This is similar to how magnets act, as N and S attract each other, and as N and N, S and S push each other.
This is because electric charges make an electric field. If two fields exist in the same space at the same time, then the two fields exert (~ put) force on each other. The force they make on each other is called Coulomb's force or electrostatic force. Coulomb's law explains how big the force will be.
Coulomb's law explains the scale between two electric charges.
The scale of electrostatic force follows the function below.
Coulomb's law explains that the force scale F is relative to ratio of formula_2,formula_3.
formula_4 and formula_5 are the scales of each electric charge. formula_6 is the distance between the two electric charges. And formula_7 has a certain value. It does not change relative to formula_4, formula_5 or formula_6. While formula_11 remains constant, when multiples of formula_4 and formula_5 become bigger, the electrostatic force will also get bigger. When the distance formula_6 become bigger, the electrostatic force will become smaller to ratio of formula_3.
The exact size of formula_7 is
formula_17
formula_18N m C (or m F). This constant is called Coulomb's Force Constant or Electrostatic Force Constant.
The relation between the force of pushing or pulling (F) and the distance between the particles (formula_6) follows the Inverse-square Law. Inverse-square law means that when the distance formula_6 grows bigger, the force gets weaker by the ratio formula_3. Gravitation, Electromagnetic radiation, Sound Intensity also follows this law.

Hereford (cattle)

Hereford cattle are a widely used breed in temperate areas, mainly for beef production.
Originally from Herefordshire, England, they are found in the temperate parts of Australia. The breed also enjoys great popularity among ranchers in the desert American Southwest of the United States, as well as in the centre and east of Argentina and in Uruguay. Herefords made up the largest percentage of registered cows among herders in New Zealand. This is a testament to the hardiness of the breed; while originating in cool, moist Britain, they have thrived in much harsher climates. The breed has adapted to a wide range of climates on nearly every continent.
Hornless variants with the polled gene are known as the Polled Herefords. Breeding horned and hornless together functions as a genetic dehorner. This is often used as an alternative to a dehorning process, which causes stress and often weight loss.

Roman army

The Roman army is the military of ancient Rome, the forces used by the Roman Kingdom, Roman Republic and later Roman Empire. Its infantry for much of its history, was the Roman legion. Rome also had a navy. The size of the army in the late Roman Empire was about 128,000 179,200 men. It was very well organized. The main Roman soldiers in the Empire were the legionaries. The legions were separated into centuries, made up of 80 soldiers and 20 other men who remained in the camp to cook and do other chores. 
Other soldiers in the army were called the auxilia. Auxilia were non-citizens who mainly came from the provinces. They were paid less than legionaries and did not usually wear armor but at the end of their service, which was a minimum of 25 years, they were given Roman citizenship.
The army had cavalry units called Equites. Their men were rich enough to have horses and more expensive weapons. Being few, they were less important in battle than the infantry.
The soldiers of the Roman army wore helmets and body protection. In the early to mid-Republican era, legionaries usually bought their own equipment. "Hastati", the first line of soldiers, usually had breastplates, called a "cuirass", and some wore "lorica hamata", or chainmail. The richer principes, the second line of soldiers, could afford "lorica hamata" but they were sometimes seen wearing the cheaper "cuirasses". Both hastati and principes were each armed with a "gladius" - a short, 60 centimeter (two foot) sword - and each had two "pila" - short spears. 
The third line of soldiers, the Triarii, had a "hasta", a two meter long spear. They were also armed with the "gladius" and had an early form of the "lorica segmenta" or iron band armor. All legionaries had a large rectangular shield, the "scutum", which had rounded corners.
By the late Republican period, all legionaries carried a "gladius", two "pila", a new, larger "scutum", and wore chainmail." Lorica segmentata" was only commonly worn between the 2nd and 3rd century.
Larger weapons such as the ballista (large crossbow) and the Onager (catapult) were used in larger battles.
The main thing a member of the Roman Army needed was physical fitness. Soldiers were expected to march about 36 km (24 miles) in five hours. They also had to be fit to be able to fight well and cope with any injuries.
New soldiers would do two sessions of military drill and give their oath of loyalty to their Commander and Emperor. Every day the whole of the legion would practice running, jumping, sword fighting and javelin throwing.

Tierpark Hagenbeck (translated as Animal park Hagenbeck) is the name of the largest zoo in Hamburg, Germany. The park was founded by Carl Hagenbeck in 1907. His father was a fishmonger (a person who buys and sells fish). It is the first zoo in the world to use moats (a moat is a large hole or trench. Animals do not dare cross it).
This was done instead of using cages with bars, so the animals would feel more at home. 
Bombs in the Second World War completely destroyed the zoological garden. With much help from the founding family, it was rebuilt after the war. Two Indian Elephants helped to clear the rubble in the zoo.
There are 210 different species in the Tierpark Hagenbeck. The sadness is the only swan which is almost completely black, the Mourning swan. There are also mandrills and baby elephants but no tapir. There is breeding for Orangutan, North Chinese leopard and giant otters from South America.

Limit of a function

In calculus, a branch of mathematics, the limit of a function is the behavior of a certain function near a selected input value for that function. Limits are one of the main calculus topics, along with derivatives, integration, and differential equations.
The definition of the limit is as follows:
The notation for the limit above is read as "The limit of formula_1 as formula_3 approaches formula_4 is formula_2." Imagine we have a function such as formula_10. When formula_11, formula_1 is undefined, because formula_13. Therefore, on the Cartesian coordinate system, the function formula_10 would have a vertical asymptote at formula_11. In limit notation, this would be written as:
For the function formula_10, we can get as close to formula_18 in the formula_3-values as we want, so long as we "don't" make formula_3 equal to formula_18. For instance, we could make x=.00000001 or -.00000001, but never 0. Therefore, we can get formula_1 as close as we want to formula_19, but without reaching it. The Left limit is any value that approaches the limit from numbers less than the number, and the Right limit is any value that approaches the limit from number greater than the limit number. For instance, in the function formula_10, since the limit for formula_3 is 0, if formula_30, it approaches the limit from the right. If we instead choose -1, we say it approaches the limit from the left.

Arthur Phillip

Admiral Arthur Phillip RN (11 October 1738 – 31 August 1814) was a British naval officer. Phillip was made Governor of New South Wales, the first European colony in Australia, which is now the city of Sydney.
Arthur (Kriddler) Phillip was born in Fulham, London, in 1738. His father was a German-born language teacher, Jacob Phillip. His mother, Elizabeth Breach, was English, and the widow of a navy captain. Phillip went to a school for poor boys at the Greenwich Hospital. At the age of 13 he joined the merchant navy. Phillip joined the Royal Navy at 15. He saw action during the Seven Years' War in the Mediterranean at the Battle of Minorca in 1756. In 1762 he was promoted to Lieutenant. When the war ended in 1763 he was put on half pay. He married and became a farmer in Lyndhurst, Hampshire. He separated from his wife about six years later.
In 1774 Phillip joined the Portuguese Navy as a captain. He served in the Spanish-Portuguese War, 1776–1777. Phillip took a group of convict ships from Portugal to Brazil. This trip was a success because not many people died. This may have been one of the reasons Phillip was asked to lead the expedition to Australia. In 1778 England was at war again, and Phillip was recalled to active service. In 1779 he was given his first command, the ship "Basilisk". He was promoted to captain in 1781, and given command of the "Ariadne". In 1782 he was captain of the "Europe" with his friend Philip Gidley King as his lieutenant. They sailed to India. In 1784 he was back on half pay in England. He spent time in southern France and in 1786 was doing survey work for the Royal Navy.
In October 1786, Phillip was made Governor of New South Wales. The British government wanted to start a penal colony (prison) on the east coast of Australia. Phillip knew about farming, and had taken prisoners to Brazil for the Portuguese. This made him a good choice to be leader. Phillip had a very hard time getting the ships ready for the eight month sea voyage to Australia. He had to take everything that the new colony might need. Phillip had no real idea of what he might find when he got there. There wasn't much money to buy things. He wanted people who knew about farming, building and making things, but this was rejected. Most of the 772 convicts (prisoners) were thieves from the city area of London. Phillip also took a group of marines (soldiers) and small group of officers who were to help him run the new colony.
The First Fleet, of 11 ships, sailed on 13 May 1787. The first ship, HMS "Supply", reached Botany Bay on 18 January 1788. Phillip soon decided that this site, picked by Sir Joseph Banks, was not suitable. It had poor soil, no safe place to leave the ships, and no drinking water. Phillip decided to go north to Port Jackson. On 26 January 1788 (this day is now called Australia Day) the marines and convicts landed at Sydney Cove. It was a successful trip, as only 40 convicts had died. Phillip named Sydney after Lord Sydney.
The first years of the settlement were very hard. They only had the supplies they brought with them. They had to start growing their own food, but the soil around Sydney was poor. They didn't know about the climate, how much rain or when it would fall for example. Very few of the convicts knew anything about farming or growing food. They did not have enough farming tools. The convicts did not want to be farm workers. The colony was in danger of starvation for long time. The soldiers, who didn't like being given orders in many cases, did not think it was their job to make the convicts work. Phillip had to put some convicts in charge (overseers) to get the other convicts working. This was the start of the process of making some convicts free which led to the reforms of Lachlan Macquarie after 1811. As Governor of the new settlement, Phillip had complete power over the eastern half of Australia.
Phillip had respect from the Aboriginal people because he was missing a front tooth. This tooth was the same tooth that they knocked out as part of their initiation ceremonies.
Phillip soon had problems with the soldiers in the penal colony. Life in Sydney was difficult, without proper houses and not enough food. The officer in charge of the soldiers, Major Robert Ross, wanted to give up the settlement and go back to England. Ross complained about Phillip and wrote letters to the government in England about him. The soldiers thought they should be given land and other benefits. They thought they should be given more food than the convicts, but Phillip believed everyone should have an equal share. Ross and the soldiers believed that they were in Australia to protect the settlement from being attacked by other countries. They did not think that their work included guarding the convicts. Ross who was a soldier, did not think he should have to take orders from Phillip, who was a navy man. In March 1790, Phillip finally sent Ross to be in charge of the colony on Norfolk Island. The British government continued to send out convicts, there were over 4000 in Sydney by 1792. Food still needed to be brought in as the colony could not yet grow enough. Phillip began giving small grants of land to ex-convicts to start farms around Parramatta, New South Wales.
On 11 December 1792 Phillip left to go back to England. He needed medical treatment for a pain in his side. The pain was kidney pain from eating so much salted food. He planned to return to Australia, but on medical advice he resigned as Governor and stayed in England. He married Isabella Whitehead in 1794. He eventually got better and in 1796 returned to the navy as a captain. He was in charge of the "Alexander", and later the 74 gun battleship, "Swiftshore". In January 1799 he was made a Rear Admiral of the Blue, and put in charge of the Sea Fencibles. Their job was to defend England against Napoleon. He retired from active service in 1805. He had a number of strokes which left him partly paralysed. He died at Bath, on 31 August 1814, after falling from a third floor window. He was buried at the church of St.Nicholas, Bathampton.
In 2007 Geoffrey Robertson QC found that Phillip's remains are no longer in the church. It is not known where they are. It is believed they were lost while the church was being repaired in the 1970s. Robertson believes that it is an insult to Phillip that he wasn't buried in one of England's cathedrals. He wants the remains of Phillip found and brought back to Australia.

Halting problem

The Halting problem is a problem in computer science. The problem is looking at a computer program and finding out if the program is going to run forever or not. We say that a program "solves the halting problem" if it can look at any other program and tell if that other program will run forever or not.
For example, a program like this:
will loop forever, but the program
stops very quickly.
Is there a program that solves the halting problem? It turns out there is not. We prove this fact by showing that if there is a program that solves the halting problem then something impossible happens. So for the moment we will act like there really is a program that solves the halting problem. Here, P is a function which will evaluate function F (called with argument I) and return true if it runs forever and false otherwise.
P can look at any program and find out if it will run forever or not. We use P to make a new program that we will call Q. What Q does is look at another program and then answer the following question: "If we run this program and make it look at a copy of itself, will it run forever?". We can make Q because we have P. All we need to do is to tell Q to create a new program that is the old program looking at itself, and then use P to find out if the new program runs forever or not.
Now we make another program R. R looks at another program and asks Q for its answer on that program. If Q answers "yes, if we run this program and make it look at a copy of itself it will run forever", then R stops. If Q answers "no, if we run this program and make it look at a copy of itself, it will not run forever", then R enters an infinite loop and runs forever.
Now we look at what happens if we make R look at a copy of itself. Two things can happen: it will either stop or run forever. 
If running R and making it look at a copy of itself does not run forever, then Q answered "yes, if we run this program and make it look at a copy of itself it will run forever". But Q said this when looking at R itself. So what Q actually said is: "yes, if we run R and make it look at a copy of itself it will run forever". So: If R running on a copy of itself does not run forever, then it does run forever. This is impossible.
If running R and making it look at a copy of itself runs forever, then Q answered "no, if we run this program and make it look at a copy of itself it will not run forever". But Q said this when looking at R itself. So what Q actually said is: "no, if we run R and make it look at a copy of itself it will not run forever". So: If R running on a copy of itself runs forever, then it does not run forever. This is also impossible.
No matter what happens, we get an impossible situation. We did something wrong, and we need to find out what it was. Most of the things we did were not wrong. We can not say "making a program look at a copy of itself is wrong", or "looking at what another program said and then going into a loop if it said one thing, and stopping if it said another thing" is wrong. It does not make sense to say that we are not allowed to do those things. The only thing that we did that looks like it could be wrong is that we pretended that a program like P exists in the first place. And since this is the only thing that could be wrong, and something must be wrong, this is it. This is the proof that a program like P does not exist. There is no program that solves the halting problem.
This proof was found by Alan Turing in 1936.
 This is the paper where Turing defines Turing machines, formulates the halting problem, and shows that it (as well as the Entscheidungsproblem) is unsolvable.

<doc id="121420" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=121420" title="Scottish Fold">
Scottish Fold

The Scottish Fold (sometimes called Coupari by Canadian breeders) is a breed of cat. Its distinctive ear fold is caused by a particular gene.
First known as Flops, for their "floppy" ears, Scottish Fold became the breed's name in 1966. Scottish Folds with long hair are known by a number of names. For example, it is called the Highland Fold by the ACFA, AACE, and UFO; the Scottish Fold Longhair by the TICA, NCFA, ACA, CCA, and CFA; and the Longhair Fold by the CFF.
The very first Scottish Fold was a long-haired barn cat with white fur, called Susie. She was found in 1961 at a farm near Coupar Angus in Perthshire, Scotland. Susie's ears had an unusual fold in the middle, making her look like an owl. When Susie had kittens, two of them were born with the distinctive folded ears. One was owned by William Ross, a nearby farmer and cat-lover. Ross registered the breed with the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy in Great Britain and started to breed Scottish Fold kittens with the help of Pat Turner. The breeding program ended up with 76 kittens in the first three years, 42 with folded ears. They suspected that the ear mutation was from a dominant allele. This means that if one parent has straight ears, and one parent has folded ears, half of the kittens will be Folds.
Susie's only fertile offspring was a female Fold named Snooks, also white like her mother. A second kitten was neutered shortly after birth. Three months after Snooks' birth, Susie was killed by a car. All Scottish Fold cats are related to Susie and Snooks. This kind of ancestry is very rare, even among pedigreed animals.
The breed was not accepted for showing in Great Britain and Europe because people thought that they would be overly prone to ear problems such as infection, mites, and deafness, but the Folds were sold in America. The breed kept on growing using crosses with British Shorthairs and American Shorthairs. Despite the initial concerns, the Fold breed has not had the expected mite and infection problems. However, wax can build up faster than in the ears of other cats.
Folds are very popular pets because of their unique look, and their reputation as particularly loving companions. Fold kittens are usually much more expensive to buy than kittens of more common breeds.
All Folds are born with straight, unfolded ears. Cats that have the Fold gene will start to show the fold before 21 days. The first cats only had one fold in their ears. With careful breeding, breeders have changed the fold to a double or triple fold. This causes the ear to lie totally flat against the head.
Folds are a medium-sized breed of cat (9–13 lbs. for males and 6–9 lbs. for females). They have round bodies, round heads, and round faces. They have big round eyes. Their noses are short with a gentle curve. They have medium to short sized legs. Their heads are curved at the top. They have very short necks. The eyes have a big gap which gives the Scottish Fold a "sweet expression".
Scottish Folds can be either long- or short-haired. They may have nearly any coat colour or mix of colours (including white) except pointed colours. According to cat-fancy website Terrific-Cats.com:
Scottish Folds, whether with folded ears or with normal ears, are normally good-natured and calm. They can adjust to other animals within a household very well. They tend to become very attached to their human caregivers. They are by nature quite loving. Folds receive high marks for playfulness, affection, and grooming. They are often clever, loyal, quiet, and do well in changing home situations.
Folds are also known for sleeping on their backs. Scottish Folds normally have soft voices. They can give a mix of meows and purrs not found in better-known breeds.
Scottish Folds usually live for around 15 years.
Scottish folds can easily get polycystic kidney disease (PKD), osteochondritis, and cardiomyopathy.
Because the ears fold nearly a month after birth, Fold kittens cannot be judged immediately as to their type or value, as the animal website PetFinder.com says:
One special medical problem comes in the Scottish Fold if both parents have folded ears. In such a case, their kittens will be very likely (1:4 ratio, or usually at least one per litter) to have a painful joint disease that can fuse the tail, ankles and/or knees. Scientists think the disease is caused by the dominant (folded-ear) gene. It is more likely to affect Folds with the gene twice, than mixed single with one recessive (unfolded-ear) gene. This disease can also affect Scottish Folds with one copy of the gene, but usually not as often or as badly. For this reason the breed is not accepted by either the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy or the Fédération Internationale Féline. This is the reasoning behind the widely-held belief that the only ethical manner of breeding Folds is Fold/nonfold and not Fold/Fold (in the same way Munchkins are bred).
The Scottish Fold is one of the main focuses in the short novel "The Cat Who Went to Paris" by Peter Gethers. The book and its two sequels, "A Cat Abroad" and "The Cat Who'll Live Forever: The Final Adventures of Norton, the Perfect Cat, and His Imperfect Human", talk about the life of Gethers and his Fold, Norton. It starts with their first meeting and ends with Norton's death and Gether's life after the loss.
Cat guides about the Scottish Fold breed can be found. For example "Scottish Fold Cats: A Complete Pet Owner's Manual" (ISBN 0812049993), "Guide to Owning a Scottish Fold Cat" (ISBN 079382172X), and "Scottish Fold Cats (Cats Set III)" (ISBN 1577658671).

The Sims 3

The Sims 3 is a computer game for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. It was released on June 2, 2009 and is a sequel to the popular "The Sims" and "The Sims 2" computer games. There have been versions of the game for consoles and mobile phones as well. "The Sims 3" was a success right when it was released. The game has sold 1.4 million copies in its first week and over ten million copies worldwide to date.
The Sims 3 is made with the same idea as the games before it. The player controls their own Sims in activities and relationships in a similar manner to real life. The game play is open-ended and has no limits. Sims houses and neighborhoods are in one huge map. The developers stated, "What you do outside your home now matters as much as what you do within." The game includes an optional feature called "Story Progression", which allows all Sims in the neighborhood to continue on their own as if the player were controlling them, such as grow up, get married, get jobs and promotions, have children, and build or buy their dream house while the player is not playing. The Sims 2 used a reward system called Wants and Fears. This is replaced with a new system called Wishes in The Sims 3. Completing a Sim's wish helps the Sim's Lifetime Happiness score and mood. Some wishes, such as "Go to the Park", may add little points to their lifetime happiness while "Have A Baby Boy" may add thousands of points. In The Sims 2, Wants and Fears also contributed to a Sim's "Aspiration" meter, the same to current self-esteem. In The Sims 3, Aspiration is removed entirely, replaced with "Moodlets", which contribute good or bad values to the original Motivation meter. Moodlets can be inspired by physical events, such as having a good meal or comfort from sitting in a good chair, as well as emotional events like a first kiss or a break-up. Most moodlets last for a set amount of time, but some bad Moodlets can be cured (such as the one caused by a need to use the bathroom) and some positive ones rely on the Sim's surroundings and traits.

Ambush marketing

Ambush marketing is a form of marketing. Many events, especially in sports have sponsors. These sponsors pay money, which makes it possible to hold the event. In return for this, they get publicity and media coverage. Ambush marketing is a name given to marketing campaigns that are also done around the event, but where no money is paid for the event.
There are many very important events where one company will pay money to become the "exclusive sponsor" of the event (or in a category of the event). This creates a problem for other brands or companies. These other brands then find ways to promote themselves in connection with the same event. They do not pay the sponsorship fee. Even if they wanted to, they could not, because one brand is the exclusive sponsor. They also do not break any laws.
For the 2011 Rugby World Cup and the 2015 Cricket World Cup, New Zealand is planning to make laws to combat ambush marketing, according to former Sports Minister Trevor Mallard.

Achaemenid Empire

The Achaemenid Empire, or "Achaemenid Persian Empire", (550–330 BC) was the first of the Persian Empires to rule over significant portions of Greater Persia (or Iran). It followed the Median Empire as the second great empire of the Iranian peoples. At the height of its power, the Achaemenid Empire had about 7.5 million square kilometers and was territorially the largest empire of classical antiquity.
The empire was forged by Cyrus the Great. It spanned three continents, including parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan; parts of Central Asia, Asia Minor, Thrace; much of the Black Sea coastal regions; Iraq, northern Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Syria; and all significant population centers of ancient Egypt as far west as Libya. The empire was the foe of the Greek city-states in the Greco-Persian Wars. It freed the Israelites from their Babylonian captivity, and instituted Aramaic as the empire's official language. Because of the Empire's vast extent and long endurance, Persian influence upon the language, religion, architecture, philosophy, law and government of nations around the world lasts to this day.
The empire began as a tributary state of the Medes but ended up conquering and enlarging the Median empire to include Egypt and Asia Minor. Under Xerxes, it came very close to conquering Ancient Greece. The Achaemenids were overthrown by the conquest of Alexander the Great in 330 BCE.

The Dark Knight (movie)

The Dark Knight is a 2008 British-American superhero movie. It was released on July 18, 2008 in the United States. It stars Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Michael Caine, and Aaron Eckhart. It was directed by Christopher Nolan. It is the sequel to the 2005 movie "Batman Begins". "The Dark Knight" broke many records on its release. It was the second movie in "The Dark Knight Trilogy". The third movie is "The Dark Knight Rises".
The movie begins with the Joker and his gang of clowns robbing a mob bank. The other clowns shoot each other so that there are fewer people so they can get more money per person. The manager of the bank takes out his shotgun and shoots one of them. The Joker takes off his mask and kills the last clown, leaving all the money for himself. He then drives away in a school bus.
The crime mob in the city is very mad at the Joker for robbing the bank. The Joker comes to them and says he wants to kill Batman. Meanwhile, Gotham city's District Attorney Harvey Dent tries to shut the mob down by tracking down the money. A businessman named Lau finds out about this and takes the money out beforehand and goes to Hong Kong so that he cannot be caught. Batman, whose real name is Bruce Wayne, flies down there himself, kidnaps him, and takes him back to Gotham City.
The Joker says he wants Batman to take his mask off and show the world who he is, and that if he does not, people will die. Commissioner Loeb dies from drinking acid in his drink and the judge that was at the mob trials is killed. The Joker then hires some men to kidnap police officers and take their uniforms. At Loeb's funeral, Joker's men attempt to shoot the mayor. Police officer James Gordon tackles the mayor and is shot and apparently killed.
Dent then calls a press conference to ask the people there if he should reveal Batman. After they say yes, Dent says that he is Batman and has the police arrest him. They put him on a truck to send him to jail. The Joker and his men drive a truck that badly damages the truck Dent is riding in. The real Batman comes in and attempts to save Dent but wrecks his motorcycle-like Batpod when the Joker stands there, since Batman has a rule that he will not kill anyone. Gordon, who is revealed to have faked his death, arrests the Joker.
In jail, Batman questions the Joker. The Joker eventually reveals that his men captured Rachel Dawes, Batman's old childhood friend and Dent's girlfriend, and Dent. He has put them in warehouses far away so that Batman cannot save both of them himself. They are near bombs that will go off and kill them. The Joker tells Batman where each person is. Batman goes to save Dawes while Gordon and his men go to rescue Dent. However, when Batman gets to Rachel's location, he only sees Dent, because the Joker switched the addresses. Batman gets Dent out, but the bomb goes off and Dent scars half of his face. Gordon is too late to save Dawes.
The Joker gets out of jail. He gets his phone call and dials a cell phone that is wired to a bomb, which blows up the police station. Afterwards, he visits the hopsital where Dent is staying. Dent is driven crazy because of Dawes' death. The Joker frees Dent and tells him to take revenge. Dent goes around flipping coins and decides whether he will kill them or keep them alive. He starts going after the various police people who leaked information to the Joker to make it possible for him to kidnap and kill Dawes.
The Joker then announces that the city is his. The people in charge load up two ferries with people to get them out of the city. The Joker has wired both boats with explosives and has given each boat the detonator to the other one, saying that he will blow up both boats at midnight if one boat does not blow up the other.
Batman finds the Joker in an abandoned building. He uses a sonar system (created by Lucius Fox) to defeat the Joker's men and stops him from destroying both ferries. He then leaves the Joker hanging. The Joker is very impressed, stating that Batman cannot be corrupted into breaking his own rule. A SWAT team then captures the Joker.
At the end of the movie, Batman finds that Dent has kidnapped Gordon's family. When Batman arrives, Dent flips his coin to decide their fates. Before he can see the result of his next coin flip, Batman tackles Dent off the edge of the building, letting the vigilante plummet to his death. With Dent dead, Gordon says that if word gets out that Dent killed all these people, all the work he did will have been lost. Batman offers to take the blame for all the murders. Gordon, who is originally against it, agrees. He destroys the Bat-Signal and orders the police to hunt Batman down. Batman takes off into the night while Gordon’s son does not understand the reasoning for why Batman must be hunted. But Gordon explains "because he can take it. Because he's not a hero. He's a silent guardian; a watchful protector; a Dark Knight."
The movie was filmed in Chicago and in Hong Kong. Some scenes were shot in London. During the filming in Chicago, Nolan decided to blow-up abandoned Brach's candy factory (which was Gotham Hospital in the movie).

Gorgon

In Greek mythology, the Gorgons were female monsters that had fangs and serpents for hair with bronze claws. They were the daughters of Phorkys and Keto. The serpents in their hair were special: Everyone who looked at them was turned to stone. There were three Gorgons, named Stheno, Euryale and Medusa. Only Medusa was mortal. She was beheaded by Perseus. Medusa's head was brought to Athena. There are many motives showing Athena with an aegis, and a Gorgon's head on her chest. 
Homer only talks about one Gorgon. Hesiod names all three, Stheno, the powerful one, Euryale,who could jump far, and trouble-ridden Medusa, the queen. According to Hesiod, they lived at the edge of the known world, in the Atlas Mountains. At a later time, Libya is also named as their home.
With Hellenism came the myth that the Gorgo was a sister of Alexander the Great. In this myth, she is a neck, a water spirit. The sailors of each passing boat are asked whether he is still alive. If they answer no, she takes the boat and the sailors into the water. The answer that saves the lives of the seamen is "Yes, and he reigns as a king" (Greek: Ζεί και βασιλέβει). 
The heads of the Gorgons are often found on shields, capes and amulets. These were believed to be magic. The magic that is used against bad spirits and bad look is known as apotropaic magic.

As the World Turns

As the World Turns (ATWT) is an American television soap opera that airs each weekday on CBS. 
Set in the made-up town of Oakdale, Illinois, the show first went on TV on Monday, April 2, 1956 at 1:30pm EST. Before this show, all soaps were fifteen minutes in length; ATWT was the first half-hour soap opera.
At first, viewers were not excited about it, but ratings picked up in its second year, and reached the top spot in the daytime Nielsen Ratings by the fall of 1958. "As the World Turns" was the most-watched daytime drama from 1958 until 1978, with ten million people watching each day. At its height, the main actors such as Helen Wagner, Don MacLaughlin, Don Hastings, and Eileen Fulton became very well known in the United States.
The show went from black-and-white to color in the mid-1960s, with the final black-and-white episode shown on February 10 1967. The show went from a half-hour in length to one hour starting on December 1 1975. Also in 1975, they stopped doing the show live, and decided to tape it instead - that way, more than one episode could be taped in a day, and the actors would not have to work every day.
April 2, 2006 was the 50th anniversary of the soap opera on CBS. The show aired its 13,000th episode April 23, 2007; the 10,000th episode aired on May 12 1995. "As the World Turns" is well known for having been taped in New York City for all of its 52 years on television (43 years in Manhattan and nine years in Brooklyn).
On December 8, 2009, CBS announced that '"As the World Turns" would air its last episode in September 2010.

"EarthBound" is the only game of the three that came out in English, and it has a strong fanbase that wants the other two games in English too.
The series takes place by travelling in western directions for the most part, but it also goes to other places like deserts, a prehistoric world, and a dream world.
"Mother" is the first title in the "EarthBound" series. It was made by Ape, Inc. and designed by Shigesato Itoi for the NES. It was going to be called "EarthBound" in the United States, and Nintendo of America completed the translation of the game, but they decided that role-playing video games weren't very worth releasing, and that it was too late in the NES' life to release.
"EarthBound" (known as "Mother 2" in Japan) is the second title in the series. It's the most well-known because it was the only one released outside of Japan. It was made by Ape, Inc. for the Super NES. It stars a boy named Ness, a girl named Paula, a boy named Jeff, and a boy named Poo, who have to work together to defeat an evil alien called Giygas, who conquers the Earth 10 years in the future.
"Mother 3" is the third and latest "EarthBound" game. It was made by Brownie Brown and released for the Game Boy Advance. It started on the Nintendo 64 as "EarthBound 64", but got canceled since the N64 was almost done. It was announced in 2003 that it was going to move to the Game Boy Advance, and came out in 2006. It changed from 3D to 2D, but it kept the same characters and story. It never came outside of Japan because of "EarthBound"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s low sales in the United States, though there have been a lot of rumors, including one in Electronic Gaming Monthly about a game called "Mother Compilation" for the Nintendo DS which would include all three games. "Mother 3" is about the adventures of a boy named Lucas and his dog Boney, who joins up with a princess named Kumatora and a thief named Duster who have to fight the Pig Mask Army. Shigesato Itoi, the creator, has no plans to make a sequel.
Nintendo made a collection of "Mother" and "EarthBound" for the Game Boy Advance called "Mother 1 + 2". It never came out of Japan. There has not been another re-release of any of the games since, but "EarthBound" was rated by the ESRB for a Virtual Console release.
"EarthBound" has always been in the "Super Smash Bros." series. In "Super Smash Bros.", Ness (from "EarthBound") is a playable character, using special PSI moves and attacks from "EarthBound". He appeared again in "Super Smash Bros. Melee" with some new moves, and was going to be replaced by Lucas because he was going to be the star of "EarthBound 64", but since it was canceled, he kept Ness instead. "Melee" also added stages from "EarthBound" based on two of the towns from the second game, and collectible trophies of characters and items from it. "Super Smash Bros. Brawl" brought Ness back, but also added Lucas since "Mother 3" came out. It also added a stage from "Mother 3" and new trophies too.

It was one of the most primitive members of its group, living 33 to 32 million years ago in the early Oligocene. It was quite small, averaging 5.2 lbs (2.4 kg) in weight.
Its diet probably consisted of small mammals, amphibians, reptiles and insects.
Although "Badjcinus" was successful in its period, it probably was pushed out by other, better developed thylacinids. The fossils were found at Riversleigh in north-west Queensland, Australia.

Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics

The Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics, (NUTS) for the French nomenclature d'unités territoriales statistiques, is a geocode standard that shows the administrative divisions of countries for statistical purposes. It was made by the European Union, so it only covers the member states of that union in detail. 
A NUTS code begins with a two-letter code referencing the country, and is identical to the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code (the only difference is "UK" instead of "GB" for the United Kingdom). The subdivision of the country is then displayed by one number. A second or third subdivision level is referred to with another number each. Each numbering starts with 1, as 0 is used for the upper level. In case the subdivision has more than 9 entities, capital letters are used to continue the numbering.
In addition to the full three levels for the European Union countries, all countries have a NUTS code with a two-letter code for a continent and two numbers for the country, and for the USA, Canada and Australia the states, provinces, and territories are numbered separately.
Some are not easily classified: for example, Gibraltar is listed as being outside the EU with the code EO21; while French Guiana is listed twice, once in France as FR930 and once in South America as AS13.
NUTS, in some ways are similar to the ISO 3166-2 standard, as well as the FIPS standard of the United States.
There are three levels of NUTS. Some with two levels of local administrative units (LAUs) below. These were called NUTS levels 4 and 5 until July 2003, but were changed due to official regulations although they are sometimes still described as such. Note that not all countries have every level of division, depending on their size. One of the most extreme cases is Luxembourg, which has only LAUs; the three NUTS divisions each correspond to the entire country itself.

Fire blight

Fire blight is a contagious disease of rosaceous plants
Infections get into open blossoms and tender new shoots and leaves in the spring when blossoms are open. There is no known cure; prevention is the key.
Spraying plants with streptomycin or injecting plants with oxytetracycline can prevent new infections. That leads to antibiotic resistance. Spraying beneficial bacteria or yeast may also prevent fire blight from infecting new trees. The only effective treatment for plants already infected is to cut off the affected branches and dispose of them.

Michael E. DeBakey

Michael Ellis DeBakey (September 7, 1908 – July 11, 2008) was an American heart surgeon who was considered to be a very important name in his area. He was also among the early names of heart surgery.
DeBakey was born as Michel Dabaghi in Lake Charles, Louisiana on September 7, 1908. His parents were born in Lebanon, but moved to America before he was born.
DeBakey was involved with medicine from a young age and went to Tulane University. He held many medicine-related positions during his lifetime.
During World War II, DeBakey made wartime medicine much better than it used to be. He was for the idea of having doctors closer to the areas of battle in war, which worked very well and due to that, more badly hurt soldiers survived. Because of this, Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals (also known as MASH units) were made, and they were used during the Korean War.
In addition to MASH units, DeBakey made many important aspects to surgery, one of which was the roller pump, which DeBakey made at age 23 while still at Tulane University. This would later on make open-heart surgery able to be done, as roller pumps can make blood flow during surgery.
DeBakey worked with another important heart surgeon, Denton Cooley, but they had a disagreement related to the first artificial heart(a manmade heart) put in a human. They did not get along for a long time, but they went on good terms in 2007.
DeBakey did something rare by still practicing medicine in old age. People that he operated on included world leaders, such as Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
In 2005, a serious heart problem happened to DeBakey. Despite him having made the surgery for this problem, he, at first, did not want any surgery. As he got in worse condition, the surgical team had made the decision to perform surgery anyway. Once the surgery was done and he got in better health, DeBakey said that he was glad the surgery happened after all. 
On July 11, 2008, DeBakey died of natural causes at age 99. His first wife, two of his sons, and a brother died before him, while his second wife, a daughter, two sons, and two sisters outlive him.

Fire Emblem

Fire Emblem is a series of video games made by Intelligent Systems. Nintendo began publishing the series on the NES console in 1990. Most of the games in the series were released in Japan. The games were released in North America and Europe. The series is a collection of turn-based strategy role-playing games. They used many characters going on a long journey to fight a common enemy.
In "Fire Emblem", the player moves units across a grid in turns. The player must deal with a challenge with each part in the story, for example, defeating all of the enemy units. A player may choose to fight, move, heal, or visit shops each turn. The battle system is made up of two units fighting each other with their selected weapon. Some weapons are better against others. For example, swords are better against axes. When units defeat others, they gain experience. This experience is used to "level up" the units and makes them stronger. A well known feature in "Fire Emblem" is that when a character is damaged very badly (loses all of their "hit points"), they can never be used in the game again.
Each "Fire Emblem" game is mainly set on a fictional continent, or a really large area. Some continents are used in more than one game. Six continents have been used in "Fire Emblem" so far.
The first six games were made in Japan. Five out of the next six games were also released in the United States. A few of the games were also released for the Virtual Console on Wii.
Marth and Roy were special (unlockable) characters in the Super Smash Bros. Melee roster. Marth returned to Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Ike was added instead of Roy returning.

BioShock

BioShock is a first person shooter/Horror video game made by 2K Games for the Xbox 360, Windows, and PlayStation 3 game consoles. It got very good reviews and sold very well. The game's story is about a man who is in a plane crash in the Pacific Ocean and finds a lighthouse in the middle of the sea, which takes him to an underwater city created by a man named Andrew Ryan called Rapture, which is home to many violent creatures called Splicers.
"BioShock" is set during 1960, in Rapture, a fictional underwater city. The player learns about Rapture by listening to voice recordings. Rapture was created by a man called Andrew Ryan, who did not like cruel political, economic, and religious power over land. The city was secretly built in 1946 on a mid-Atlantic seabed, using submarine volcanoes to give geothermal power. Scientific progress grew in Rapture, leading to fast developments in engineering and biotechnology thanks in part to the brilliant scientists that Ryan brought to the city. Scientists also made ADAM, stem cells harvested from an unknown species of sea slug, which were discovered by Dr. Bridgette Tenenbaum to have the ability to heal damaged tissue and rewrite the human genome. Tenenbaum joined with businessman and mobster Frank Fontaine to create the plasmid industry, which offered superhuman physical enhancements to its customers. Tenenbaum found that ADAM could be mass-produced by implanting the slugs in the stomachs of young girls ("Little Sisters"), taken from orphanages founded by Fontaine.
As time passed, the gap between rich and poor increased. Frank Fontaine created charity organizations to support the underclass. His goal was to use his charity organizations to manipulate the poor. He also made a smuggling operation to supply citizens with forbidden items from the surface, such as religious material. These, along with his control of the plasmid industry, made him immensely powerful. He tried to overthrow Ryan, but the revolt was violently crushed and Fontaine was said to be dead. Ryan seized control of Fontaine's plasmid business. Within a few months, a new figure named Atlas rose as the leader of the disgruntled lower class. On New Year's Eve of 1959, Atlas and his ADAM-infused followers began a new revolt against Ryan that spread throughout Rapture. Ryan in turn began splicing his own forces, and his paranoia had reached such a level he was hanging dozens of people, mostly innocent, in Rapture's main square. In order to solve ADAM shortages, the Little Sisters were mentally conditioned to wander the city and extract ADAM from the dead, recycling it into raw ADAM in their stomachs after swallowing it. "Big Daddies", enhanced and mentally sterilized humans in armored diving suits, were created by Dr. Suchong, the scientist behind many plasmids, to protect the Little Sisters in their work.
A drawback of ADAM is that a user must take regular infusions or suffer mental and physical problems. As the war hurt production and supply, every ADAM user in the city went violently insane. By the time the player arrives, only a handful of non-mutated humans survive in hideouts.
At the start of the game, player-character Jack is a passenger on a plane that goes down in the Atlantic Ocean in 1960, after ordered society in Rapture has collapsed. After surfacing, Jack finds himself the only survivor of the crash, and swims to a nearby lighthouse on an island, where he finds a bathysphere which he uses to sink into the ocean and enter the city of Rapture. An Irishman named Atlas uses the service radio found in the bathysphere to help Jack in making his way to safety. Meanwhile, Ryan, believing Jack to be an agent of a surface nation, uses Rapture's automated systems and his pheromone-controlled Splicers to try to kill Jack. Atlas tells Jack that the only way he can survive is to use the abilities granted by plasmids, and that he must kill the Little Sisters to extract their ADAM. Overhearing Atlas' words, Dr. Tenenbaum intercepts Jack, and urges him to save the Little Sisters instead, giving him a plasmid that will displace the embedded sea slugs in each Sister. Atlas says his wife and child have been hiding on a submarine and directs Jack towards it. Just as Jack and Atlas reach the bay where it is located, Ryan has it destroyed; an angry Atlas asks Jack to kill Ryan.
Eventually, after completing tasks like saving an artificial forest from dying and helping an insane artist build his sculpture, Jack confronts Ryan in his office, who is playing golf. Ryan reveals a truth that he has pieced together. He is Ryan's illegitimate son by an affair with Jasmine Jolene, a dancer. When Jolene became pregnant with Jack, she, in desperate need of money, had her embryo surgically removed and sold it to the highest bidder. She had not realized it was Frank Fontaine who purchased the son, leading to her death by an angry Ryan. Ryan further reveals that, after purchasing Jack's embryo, Fontaine made him to obey orders when he is told "Would you kindly..." Jack was then sent to the surface when the war started to put him beyond Ryan's reach. When the conflict between Fontaine and Ryan reached a stalemate, Jack was sent instructions to board a flight with a package and to use its contents, a revolver, to hijack and crash the plane near the lighthouse, enabling him to return to Rapture as a tool of Fontaine. Because Jack was Ryan's son, he could freely use Rapture's bathysphere network, which had been locked out to everyone except those within Ryan's "genetic ballpark". Finally, Ryan has Jack kill him, wanting to die on his own terms. With Ryan's death, Jack realizes too late that Atlas has also been using the trigger phrase to control him. Atlas reveals himself as Fontaine, who faked his death to throw Ryan off his trail and take control of the city, leaving Jack at the mercy of the reactivated security systems. Dr. Tenenbaum and her Little Sisters help Jack escape through the vent system, where he falls and loses consciousness.
When Jack awakens, Dr. Tenenbaum has already turned off the trigger phrase. When it becomes clear to Fontaine that he is losing control of Jack, Fontaine points out the fact that Tenenbaum has survived both World War II as a Holocaust victim and the battle in Rapture, hinting that she has a secret agenda of her own. With the help of the Little Sisters, Jack is able to track down Fontaine. Fontaine, having been cornered, injects himself with huge amounts of ADAM and becomes an monster. Jack battles Fontaine, eventually beating and allowing the Little Sisters to take the ADAM from Fontaine, killing him.
Three endings are possible depending on how the player interacted with the Little Sisters, all narrated by Dr. Tenenbaum. If the player harvested "no" Little Sisters (thereby saving their lives), the ending shows five Little Sisters returning to the surface with Jack and living full lives under his care, including their graduating from college, getting married, and having children; it ends on a heart-warming tone, with an elderly Jack surrounded on his deathbed by all five of the adult Little Sisters.
If the player harvested (and thereby killed) "all" or almost all of the Little Sisters, the game ends with Jack turning on the Sisters after defeating Fontaine, presumably killing them all and taking their ADAM. Tenenbaum narrates what occurred, angry Jack and his actions, voice thick with anger. Later in the second ending, a "George Washington"-class submarine carrying nuclear missiles comes across the wreckage of the plane and is suddenly surrounded by bathyspheres containing Splicers. The Splicers kill all hands aboard the submarine and take control of it.
If the player killed more than one Little Sister, but not enough to obtain the previous ending, the ending is the same to the second one, but the tone of Tenenbaum's voice is a sad one, as opposed to angry and there are minor dialogue changes.

Dilemma

A dilemma (Greek δί-λημμα "double proposition") is a problem with at least two solutions or possibilities. None of the solutions are practically acceptable; a person in this position has been traditionally described as being impaled on the horns of a dilemma, neither horn being comfortable.
The dilemma is sometimes used as a rhetorical device, in the form "you must accept either A, or B"; here A and B would be propositions each leading to some further conclusion. Applied in this way, it may be a fallacy, a false dichotomy.
In formal logic, the definition of a dilemma differs markedly from everyday usage. Two options are still present, but choosing between them is immaterial because they both imply the same conclusion. Symbolically expressed thus:
formula_1
This can be translated informally as "one (or both) of A or B is known to be true, but they both imply C, so regardless of the truth values of A and B we can conclude C."
Horned dilemmas can present more than two choices. The number of choices of Horned dilemmas can be used in their alternative names, such as two-pronged (two-horned) or dilemma proper, or three-pronged (three-horned) or trilemma, and so on.
Constructive dilemmas--
Destructive dilemmas--
In "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance," Robert Pirsig outlines possible responses to a dilemma. The classical responses are to either choose one of the two horns and refute the other or alternatively to refute both horns by showing that there are additional choices. Pirsig then mentions three illogical or rhetorical responses. One can "throw sand in the bull's eyes" by, for example, questioning the competence of the questioner. One can "sing the bull to sleep" by, for example, stating that the answer to the question is beyond one's own humble powers and asking the questioner for help. Finally one can "refuse to enter the arena" by, for example, stating that the question is unanswerable.

Hapkido

Hapkido () is a Korean martial art. 
To simple sight it is a combination of techniques of taekwondo with others of aikibudo. Its teaching is very much focused to the self-defence. 
The history of hapkido is enough confused, but many resources believe it to be the work of two Koreans: Choi Yong Sul (1904-1986) and Ji Han Jae (1936-). When was child, Choi had been in Japan, where it seems that he worked as servant for the master of Daito ryu Aiki jutsu, Sokaku Takeda. 
Choi had demonstrated qualities in Daito-ryu Aiki-jutsu and often in Takeda they sent him in order to face with other persons who performed martial arts. From his return to Korea, Choi had begun to give classes of martial arts. One of his students, Ji Han Jae, had made Korean traditional techniques of kicks and punches (obtained from taekkyon and from hwarangdo) a part of the collection of techniques and in result he gave it the name of hapkido in the 1959. 
Besides of Choi and Ji, many schools of Korean martial arts have taken part in the development of several techniques that have helped in causing such hapkido as it is known it.

The Royal Society

The Royal Society is a society for science and scientists. It was founded in 1660 by Charles II. It is the oldest society of its kind still in existence.
A Royal Charter, on 15 July 1662, created "The Royal Society of London".
Lord Brouncker was the first President, and Robert Hooke was Curator of Experiments. The reigning monarch has always been the patron of the Royal Society since its foundation.
The motto of the Royal Society is "Nullius in Verba" (Latin: = Nothing in words). This shows the Society's commitment to establishing scientific truth through experiment rather than by quoting authority. 
Although this seems obvious today, the philosophical basis of the Royal Society differed from previous philosophies such as scholasticism, which established scientific truth based on deductive logic, concordance with divine providence and the citation of such ancient authorities as Aristotle.
The members of the society are called Fellows of the Royal Society, and put the letters FRS after their names. They are elected by existing Fellows. All other posts, such as the Secretary and President, are also by election.
The Society's 15 Sections are administered by the permanent staff, led by the Executive Secretary, Stephen Cox CVO. The Executive Secretary is supported by the Senior Managers of the Society, including:
The Society bestows ten medals, seven awards (prizes) and nine prize lectureships variously annually, biennially or triennially, according to the terms of reference for each award. The Society also runs The Aventis Prizes for Science Books.

Hercules: The Legendary Journeys

Hercules: The Legendary Journeys is an American cult television series. It aired from January 16 1995 until November 22 1999. The series was created in 1995 by writer-producers Christian Willians under his production tag, "Pacific Renaissance Pictures LTD" with later co-executive producers being Sam Raimi, Robert Tapert, John Schulian and R. J. Stewart, the series is a Spin-off from the TV movies series aired in 1994, "Hercules and the Amazon Women", "Hercules and the Lost Kingdom", "Hercules and the Circle of Fire", "Hercules in the Underworld", and "Hercules in the Maze of the Minotaur", the last of which served mostly as a "clip show" of the previous movies as a lead up to the series, was very loosely based on the tales of the classical Greek culture hero Hercules. It ran for six seasons, producing action figures and other memorabilia as it became one of the highest rated syndicated shows in television history.
The series is set in a fantasy version of ancient Greece not precisely located in historical time. Although set in ancient Greece, the show also has a mixture of Oriental, Egyptian and Medieval elements in various episodes. The show stars Kevin Sorbo as Hercules and regularly features Michael Hurst as his sidekick Iolaus. Robert Trebor often rotates with Iolaus as Hercules' other sidekick, Salmoneus. 
Typical plot lines involve Hercules and Iolaus, or Salmoneus, saving rustic villagers from monsters, evil warlords or the often selfish whims of the gods. In the earlier episodes, as mentioned in the show's opening title, Hercules' main nemesis is his evil stepmother Hera, who seeks to destroy Hercules using various monsters, because he is a reminder of her husband Zeus' infidelity. As the series progressed, a wider range of enemies was used; notably, the malicious Ares, god of war, replaced Hera as the show's primary antagonist. Towards the end of the series Ares is himself replaced by the evil god, Dahak, who is the main villain in the show's fifth season and sets off a story arc that has Hercules traveling to Sumeria, Norseland and Éire. Although Zeus, Hercules' father, is frequently cited by Hercules as a neglectful father, Zeus' love for Hercules is well-documented in the show. Indeed, Hercules is often referred to as "the favorite son of Zeus". Zeus makes several appearances on the show, even saving his son's life and restoring his superhuman strength on one occasion when he needs it the most. Hercules, for his own part, is always there for Zeus when his father needs him, and in the end, Hercules reconciles with his father and buries whatever issues he has with the father he has come to understand and love.
The show had a successful spin-off, "", with which it shared recurring characters such as Ares, Autolycus, aforementioned Salmoneus, Aphrodite and Callisto. Both shows, although produced in New Zealand using mostly local actors who strove for American accents, were syndicated worldwide.
Hercules is the world's greatest hero. The son of Zeus, King of the Gods and the mortal woman Alcmene, Hercules uses his divine strength in the aid of all people. His father was never really there for him and Hercules looked on the centaur Ceridan, who was his master at the academy as a father figure. Despite this, there are many who wish him dead. Most notably, Hera, Queen of the Gods and the wife of Zeus, she despises Hercules because he is a testament to Zeus' infidelity and has tried to destroy Hercules and his loved ones at every opportunity. Despite the many tragedies that have befallen him, not least of which both of his wives being killed, Hercules continued to be a force of good in the world. Hercules is played by American actor Kevin Sorbo.
Iolaus has been Hercules' best friend for many years ever since they met at Cheiron's academy. A former thief, Iolaus has long since repented his unlawful ways and is now a permanent force for good. His happy-go-lucky attitude makes him a popular guy, especially among the ladies, but Iolaus has had more than his fair share of tragedy. Not only did he lose his wife Anya and their children to mysterious circumstances, but Iolaus himself has been killed three times. The first two times Hercules brought him back without too much hassle, but the third time was more complicated. In saving Nebula, Iolaus was killed by the treacherous Gilgamesh and Dahak took Iolaus' body as his own. Hercules teamed up with Zarathrusta to defeat Dahak and Iolaus was allowed to become a Servant of the Light in Heaven. Iolaus broke his pact with the angels however, in warning Hercules of Michael's plan to unleash the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse on the world. As punishment Iolaus was deprived of his status of Servant of the Light, but allowed to return to Earth to fight at Hercules' side. Iolaus is played by actors Michael Hurst and Dean O'Gorman.
"Anchor Bay Entertainment" has released all 6 seasons of "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys" as well as all TV-Movies on DVD in Region 1 for the very first time. The first two season box sets are not closed-captioned, even though the original release of episodes on TV was.

Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album

The Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album is an award given to recording artists for quality albums in the alternative rock genre at the Grammy Awards. The Grammy Awards were established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony each year by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to "honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position".
The definition of "alternative" has been debated. The award was first presented in 1991 to recognize non-mainstream rock albums "heavily played on college radio stations". According to the Academy, the award is presented to "vocal or instrumental alternative music albums containing at least 51% playing time of newly recorded music". The Academy defines "alternative" as a "non-traditional" genre that exists "outside of the mainstream music consciousness". In 1991, and from 1994 to 1999, the award was known as Best Alternative Music Performance. Beginning in 2001, award recipients included the producers, engineers, and/or mixers associated with the nominated work in addition to the recording artists.
As of 2011, Radiohead and The White Stripes share the record for the most wins in this category, having won three times each. Radiohead's lead singer, Thom Yorke, was also nominated for the 2007 award for his solo album. Beck and Coldplay have each received the award twice, the latter being the only group to win two years in a row. American artists have been presented with the award more than any other nationality, though it has been presented to musicians or groups from the United Kingdom five times, from Ireland twice, and from France once. Female musicians Tori Amos and Björk hold the record for the most nominations without a win, with five each.
 Each year is linked to the article about the Grammy Awards held that year.

Young Hercules

Young Hercules is a spin-off from "". It was aired on FOX Kids Network from September 12, 1998 to May 12, 1999. It lasted only one season with 50 episodes, and starred Ryan Gosling, replacing Ian Bohen from the pilot movie as the title character. Ian Bohen was offered the part, but opted not to spend an entire year in New Zealand where the series would shoot principal photography.
The show features the efforts of Ares, the god of war, played by Kevin Smith, who attempts often to destroy his younger half-brother to win over Zeus' good graces. Among his group is his nephew Strife (Joel Tobeck), who is the rather weaker member of the team. Strife's partner is Discord, goddess of retribution (Meighan Desmond), who acts more level-headed and power hungry than her counterpart on more than one occasion.
The storyline follows Hercules (Ryan Gosling) as he attends Cheiron's Academy to train in the arts of the warrior under the wise headmaster Cheiron the Centaur (Nathaniel Lees). He makes friends with the future king of Corinth, the prince Jason (Chris Conrad) and a thieving former member of a bandit group Iolaus (Dean O'Gorman) who was sentenced to the training academy as an alternative to prison for his crimes. Hercules also meets the academy's first female cadet, Lilith (Jodie Rimmer). Other characters of interest include Kora, the Inn Keeper, who unknown to Hercules and his friends, is a devotee of Artemis, Goddess of the Hunt. As the series develops, Kora is revealed to have special powers which allow her to do Artemis' bidding. There are hints of romance between Hercules and Kora, although their friendship keeps it all innocent. 
The overall plot of the show is to fill in any of the gaps that may exist between the version of "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys" and the episodes that transpire from his young adult life, although very loosely due to its continuity errors by neglecting the "Young Hercules" movie and the flashback episodes of the fourth season of "Hercules".

Emmaus

Emmaus is a place in named in the Bible, where Jesus had supper with two followers. These two people met Jesus after his Resurrection. The two disciples walked together on the road. Jesus started walking together with them. But they never recognized Jesus. They started to tell him what happened in Jerusalem, when Jesus was crucified. Jesus continued walking with them until they got to a village called Emmaus. They started eating supper. The two disciples still did not recognize Jesus. But when Jesus blessed the food amnd broke the bread they recognized him. When they did recognize him, he vanished. 
The event is described according to the Gospel of Luke (Luke 24:13-16...28-31):
That very day two of them were going to a village (one hundred and) sixty stadia away from Jerusalem called Emmaus, and they were speaking about all the things that had occurred. And it happened that while they were speaking and debating, Jesus himself drew near and walked with them, but their eyes were prevented from recognizing him … As they approached the village to which they were going, he gave the impression that he was going on farther. But they urged him, ‘Stay with us, for it is nearly evening and the day is declining.’ So he went in to stay with them. And it happened that, while he was with them at table, he took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them. With that their eyes were opened and they recognized him.
According to a very ancient Christian tradition, Emmaus is today's Arab village of Amwas, which lies 160 stadia (30 km, 19 miles) to the West of Jerusalem. It can take 6 to 7 hours to come from Jerusalem to Emmaus on foot, if one walks across the mountains of Judea. The place was called Nicopolis during the 3d-7th centuries AD. During Byzantine times, two big Basilicas (churches) where built here with beautiful mosaics and a baptistry (a place for baptism).
Many manuscripts of the Gospel of Luke have a shorter distance between Jerusalem and Emmaus: 60 stadia (12 km, 7 miles). It is this distance which is found in modern printed Bibles. During the Crusader and Renaissance times many Christians, traveling to the Holy Land, were looking for Emmaus at the distance of 7 miles from Jerusalem. That's why several villages which lie 12 km away from Jerusalem were thought to be Emmaus. Even today one can find three Emmaus in the Holy Land: Emmaus Nicopolis, Qubeibe and Abu-Gosh!

Greek numerals

Greek numerals are a system of representing numbers using letters of the Greek alphabet. They are also known by the names "Milesian numerals", "Alexandrian numerals", or "alphabetic numerals". In modern Greece, they are still in use for ordinal numbers, and in much of the same way that Roman numerals are in the West; for ordinary (cardinal) numbers, Arabic numerals are used.
At first, before it was used more, the Greek alphabet, Linear A and Linear B had used a different system with symbols for 1, 10, 100, 1000 and 10000 operating with the following formula: | = 1, – = 10, ◦ = 100, ¤ = 1000, ☼ = 10000.
The earliest alphabet-related system of numerals used with the Greek letters was a set of the acrophonic Attic numerals, operating much like Roman numerals (which derived from this scheme), with the following formula: Ι = 1, Π = 5, Δ = 10, ΠΔ = 50, Η = 100, ΠΗ = 500, Χ = 1000, ΠΧ = 5000, Μ = 10000 and ΠΜ = 50000.
The acrophonic system was replaced by a new alphabetic system, sometimes called the Ionic numeral system, from the 4th century BC. Each unit (1, 2, …, 9) was assigned a separate letter, each tens (10, 20, …, 90) a separate letter, and each hundreds (100, 200, …, 900) a separate letter. This requires 27 letters, so the 24-letter Greek alphabet was extended by using three obsolete letters: fau ϝ, (also used are stigma ϛ or, in modern Greek, στ) for 6, qoppa ϟ for 90, and sampi ϡ for 900. To distinguish numerals from letters they are followed by the "keraia" (Greek "—insect antenna"), a symbol similar to an acute sign (Unicode U+0374).
This alphabetic system operates on the additive principle in which the numeric values of the letters are added together to form the total. For example, 241 is represented as σμαʹ (200 + 40 + 1).
To represent numbers from 1,000 to 999,999 the same letters are reused to serve as thousands, tens of thousands, and hundreds of thousands. A "left keraia" (Unicode U+0375, ‘Greek Lower Numeral Sign’) is put in front of thousands to distinguish them from the standard use. For example, 2008 is represented as ͵βηʹ (2000 + 8).
In modern Greek, uppercase letters are used more, as in Φίλιππος Βʹ = Philip II.
The Greeks also used the myriad to denote 10,000 (Μʹ) and the myriad myriad for one hundred million (ΜΜʹ).

Hebrew numerals

The system of Hebrew numerals is a quasi-decimal alphabetic numeral system using the letters of the Hebrew alphabet.
In this system, zero does not have a place, and the number values for each letter are added together. Each unit (1, 2, ..., 9) is assigned a separate letter, each tens (10, 20, ..., 90) a separate letter, and each hundreds (100, 200, ..., 900) a separate letter.
Hebrew has masculine and feminine ways of saying the words. For just counting, feminine is used. Otherwise, the gender is used (ex. two boys, two girls).

Hercules and the Amazon Women

Hercules and the Amazon Women is a 1994 television movie starring Kevin Sorbo and Michael Hurst. This movie is loosely based on the labor of Hercules to get the Golden Girdle. Here instead of getting the Golden Girdle, he faces the Amazon women who are plaguing the men in their area. Hippolyte like in the Marvel comics and mythology falls in love with Hercules. But unlike in the myth, Hippolyte befriends Hercules.
Three men are walking through the woods, they hear strange noises and catch glimpses of something moving in the undergrowth. Suddenly they are attacked by unseen creatures. Two men are killed, but one escapes and flees the woods.
Hercules strolls into a village after returning from one of his adventures, and is greeted by Iolaus. It is established that Iolaus is getting married and that Hercules is the best man. The two men set off for Alcmene's house. While walking through the woods, they reminisce that it has been a long time since they last saw each other. Iolaus tells Hercules about his bride-to-be, Ania. They stumble upon a little girl crying alone near an altar. She tells them that a monster killed her father while they were placing an offering to the goddess. Hercules tries to comfort the girl and asks if he can help, but the girl transforms into a monster. Hercules chops off its head, thinking it is now dead, Hercules and Iolaus begin walking away. They hear a noise and turn around to see that the monster is not dead, but has now grown two new heads in the place where the previous one was. The monster is a Hydra. Hercules tells Iolaus to grab the torch from the altar, Hercules cuts off the heads and burns the Hydra, preventing it from growing new heads, thus killing it. After the Hydra is destroyed a peacock feather remains in its place, Hercules tells Iolaus that Hera is responsible for the Hydra.
Hercules and Iolaus finally reach his mother's house, after a short chat with Alcmene, Iolaus invites them both for dinner, then leaves. Later on that evening while the four are enjoying dinner, Ania glimpses a man outside the window and Hercules goes to investigate. It is Pithus, the man who escaped the creatures at the beginning of the film. He explains to Hercules about his village being attacked by the creatures and Hercules agrees to help. Iolaus persuades Hercules to let him go along for one last adventure before he is married, Hercules reluctantly relents and says that he can come along. The three men set off for the village. When they arrive Hercules asks where all the women are, Pithus tells him that they were stolen by the creatures in the forest. Hercules and Iolaus head off to find the beast and rescue the village's women. In the forest they are ambushed by the beasts, they manage to stave off the attack for a time, but Iolaus discovers that the beasts are really women. After he chases after one he is fatally injured in the fight and Hercules is captured and taken to the City of Amazons.
Hercules is then seen being taken captive by the women. He has been stripped of his shirt and chained to a wooden sled assembled by the women that is attached to a horses saddle and being pulled along. The women have also cleave gagged his mouth with a black leather strap. He is surrounded by women on each side of him and led into a village full of women. He is starred at by many of the women. A few laugh and taunt him. You can hear one of the women saying "keep him bound" and another saying "Men should be seen and not heard" in reference to him being gagged. In vein Hercules muffles angry speech through the gag. Women continue to laugh at him. In the village, some women are being trained in combat and others are doing chores. When he arrives at the end of the village, the leader of the Amazon army (Lysia) helps to release him from the sled. She tells Hercules "If you're looking for men, you won't find any. Not in the city of amazons. You're the only one and I don't think you'll last very long."
Hercules is taken by the women to the Queen, Hippolyta. She removes the gag from his mouth. She tells him that she knows he is here to defeat them and that Hercules has been beaten by women. Hercules tells her she is wrong. Using a magic candle, the Hippolyta turns Hercules into a baby telling him she will show him what he is really like. As Hercules reverts to infant form we are shown flashbacks to Hercules's youth and times when he has been told by people how to behave toward women. Later he returns to adult state, realising that Hippolyta is right and that his attitude toward women is wrong, he tells her that he can change. She says that he cannot change and that all men are the same. Hippolyta goes to consult with Hera, she tells Hippolyta to lead an attack on the village
Hercules escapes from the Amazons and warns the men of the village of the forthcoming attack. He prepares them for when the women arrive. The women ride into the village and order the men to remove their clothes, telling them they are here for only one thing. The men tell the women to sit and talk with them for a while. Pithus's wife enters her home, and her son Franco asks if she really is his mother. He tells her he often dreams about her but she has no face, she removes her mask and shows her face to Franco. Hercules stands up to Hippolyta, who says she's not afraid of Hercules. He kisses her, she tells him she's not afraid and kisses him back. The two make love. The following day the women are still with the men. The Amazons return to their city and both men and women reminisce about the night before. Hera tells Hippolyta that Hercules has tricked her and to attack the village again, this time killing all the men and boys. Hippolyta refuses but Hera possesses her. Hera, now in control of Hippolyta's action orders the women to attack the village.
Hercules stops Hippolyta and realises that she is possessed by Hera. She rides off and Hercules goes after her. As they fight Hercules tries to get through to Hippolyta, telling her that she is stronger than Hera. Hercules best her and is about to deal the fatal blow, but cannot because it is Hippolyta's body and not really Hera. Hercules leaves and Hera follows him, goading him. He tells Hera that if he or Hippolyta have to die then he will give up his life for her, saying he could not live his life without her. Upon hearing this Hera runs Hippolyta's body over the edge of a waterfall, killing her.
Hercules returns to the City of Amazons, and retrieves the candle Hippolyta used to send him back to his childhood. Zeus appears and tells him the candle does not work in the way Hercules wants it to. Hercules replies that Zeus could make it work that way. Zeus tells Hercules that if he did that he would be in big trouble with Hera, but Hercules persuades him anyway. Zeus blows out the candle and Hercules is taken back to the night of the dinner. Ania see Pithus outside the window and Hercules goes to tell him that the village does not need the help of Hercules. He explains that all the men need to do is treat the women with respect and things will sort themselves out. Pithus returns to the village and when the women come the men sort out the problems that have been occurring. Alcmene asks Hercules if there is a woman out there who will make him happy like Ania did for Iolaus, Hercules replies that he is sure there is.

Eventually, Hercules leads her to a camp of refugees from the city, which has been taken over by Hera's Blue Monks. Hercules helps the refugees take back the city.
Three men are running along the riverside. One of them stops to take a drink from the river. As he stoops down to quench his thirst a female figure composed of water rises out of the river and pulls him under, drowning him. The other two men run on. While running, one man is hit by a boulder and killed. The remaining man escapes. Elsewhere a young woman is collecting water, when the ground begins to shake. She flees back to the village to warn them that a giant is coming. The giant follows the woman to the village and rips the roof of the tavern. Hercules presents himself to the giant and the giant challenges Hercules to a fight. Hercules goes outside and he beats the giant. As the village celebrates the defeat the man from earlier in the film arrives in the village. He asks for Hercules' help. He explains to Hercules that his people have been driven from their city, the lost city of Troy.
Zeus appears and Hercules asks him if he will help him. He asks his father how to find Troy and he says that Hera made it vanish. To find it, Hercules must find the one true compass which will point the way to Troy. Hercules heads off to find the compass. He finds a tribe of men preparing to sacrifice a young virgin to their water god. Hercules saves her from being sacrificed, while unknowingly being watched by a mysterious robed figure. The woman tells Hercules that her name is Deianeira. Later in the evening as they camp for the night, Deianeira tells her a story that she is the daughter of a king. She sees the dark figure and asks who he is and why she is being followed, but the figure does not answer. Later Hercules and Deianeira arrive at the slave market looking for Queen Omphale, the last person to have possessed the compass. In order to get to see the queen, Hercules sells himself as a slave, and the queen buys him. After spending the night with the queen, Hercules gets the compass and he and Deianeira continue searching for Troy. Deianeira gets attacked by some men but the figure in the dark robe saves her and tells her to follow her destiny.
Hercules and Deianeira head on to Troy. They arrive at the ocean and the figure standing on the cliffs summons a sea serpent to do Hera's bidding. It swallows Hercules and Deianeira. Hercules kills the monster from inside and they are washed up on the shore. Deianeira sees Troy in the distance and tells Hercules that she now remembers and this is where she is from. Deianeira and Hercules get caught in a trap and taken to the king. The king is ill and he and his daughter are reunited. He tells her that the Cult of the Blue Priests have taken over the city and the people have taken refuge in the woods. He tells Deianeira to rule them well, and then dies.
Hercules tutors the people of Troy and prepares them to battle to take back Troy. Deianeira realises that the people can not beat the Cult of the Blue Priests and goes looking for the Blue Priest. The people notice that Deianeira is missing and Hercules and the people use an underground tunnel to get into the city. As the people fight the cult members Hercules goes looking for Deianeira. He finds her about to be sacrificed to Hera and saves her. The Blue Priest and Hercules fight and Hercules cuts off the priest's head. A huge storm approaches, and Zeus tells Hercules that Hera is coming for Deianeira. Hercules saves her and Hera takes Hercules instead. As Deianeira is crowned Queen of Troy we see Hercules thrown down from out of the sky. A man approaches him asking him for help. Hercules agrees and the two men walk off to the next adventure.

Hercules tells him he will find a cure for his wound. Meanwhile, all over the village fires are being inexplicably extinguished. Hercules and Chiron are talking by the fire side and the fire goes out. Hercules realizes that something is amiss.
Zeus replies that he does, but he loves Hercules more. Hercules tells Zeus he loves him too. Zeus accepts what Hercules must do, and lets him go. Hercules goes through the fire and retrieves the Torch. He throws it and it lands in Prometheus's home, waking him. Fire begins to return.

Edna Parker

Edna Ruth Scott Parker (April 20, 1893 – November 26, 2008) was an American woman who was the oldest living documented person from the death of Yone Minagawa on August 13, 2007 until November 26, 2008.
Parker was born on a farm in Morgan County, Indiana. She got a teaching certificate at Franklin College, and was a teacher for a few years until she married Earl Parker, who was her next door neighbor. He died on February 23, 1939. They had two sons, Clifford and Earl Jr., both of whom died before her.
After Earl's death, Parker lived by herself on a farm on Blueridge Road. She stayed there until she was 100, when she moved in to live with one of her sons. On a winter night, she was alone while her son and his wife went to a basketball game. When they came back, they found her in the back yard, in poor health, in the snow, and could only be seen as she had been wearing a red sweater that she liked a lot. Her family feared that she would die, but her health got much better. After that, the family thought that she needed to move to a nursing home.
Parker lived at Heritage House Convalescent Center, a retirement home in Shelbyville, Indiana. She remained in good health and was still able to walk. In April 2007, at age 114, she met with 113-year-old Bertha Fry, who was at the time the second-oldest person living in Indiana and the fifth-oldest living person. This set the highest total age for a meeting of two people.
Parker reached the age of 115 on April 20, 2008. There were two birthday parties held, the first of which was public, and the second private. The public one was celebrated on April 18, 2008, and the private on April 20. At both parties, one hundred fifteen balloons of many colors floated in the air, because she liked to see balloons in the air. This was Parker's final year, as she lived until November 26 of that year at age 115 years, 220 days.

Savate

Savate, also known as "boxe française" (French boxing) or French kickboxing, is a French martial art - a kind of "boxe pieds-poings" - which use the hands and the feet as weapons and includes elements of Western boxing, techniques of grappling and techniques of leg (only with the feet: neither knee, nor shin). The persons who perform savate are called "savateurs" or ""tireurs"" in case of the men, and "savateuses" in case of the women.
Savate carry its name from the French word for "old shoe" (heavy shoes that were used to use during the combats) and is now a combination of the French techniques of fighting from beginning of the century XIX. In that age, savate was a kind of fighting which was common in Paris and in the North of France. In the South, especially in the port of Marseilles, the seamen had developed other style known as "jeu marseillais" ("the game of Marseilles"), that has obtained a new name "chausson" ("slipper", that was the shoes that the seamen used). Differently, in that age in England (the place of birth of boxing and the rules of Queensberry), people treated kicking as non-fair in sport or as something what only the cowards used more.
The two persons who has been recorded in the history of changing of street combat into modern savate are Michel Casseux (also known as "le Pisseux") (1794-1869), and Charles Lecour (1808-1894). Casseux opened in 1825 the first building in order to perform and to help in the development of a version of "chausson" and savate with rules (refusing to allow the strikes with the head, attacks with the fingers to the eyes, etc.). Anyhow, such sport still have been limited by its opinion of street combat. A student of Casseux, Charles Lecour had been exposed to the English art of boxing in the year 1830 and he had felt himself misfit, because he used his hands in order to hit the feet of the opponent and to drive them away in this way, instead of punching as in boxing. By that reason he trained himself in boxing during two years and in 1832 he combined boxing with "chausson" and savate in order to create such sport of "savate boxe française" as we know it today.
Probably the more outstanding recognition as soon as to the esteem of savate came in 1924 when had been included as sport of exhibition in the Olympic Games of Paris. In spite of its roots, savate is a sport relatively safe in order to learn. According to USA Savate , savate is in the lower places of injuries when is compared with the soccer, football, hockey, gymnastics, basketball, baseball and speed skating.

At present, savate is performed in all the world by interested people: from Australia to United States and from Finlandia to the United Kingdom. Many lands, as is case of United States has national federations very interested for helping in the development of this sport.
The modern savate gives three levels of competition: "assault", "precombat" and "combat". In assault, the competitors need to be concentrated on the technique during they are trying make contact; refrees punish with penatlties the usage of excessive force. Precombat permits fighting without thoughtlessness in the force always and when the fighters wear protection as helmets and shin protectors. Combat, the level more intensified, is similar to the precombat but the usage objects of protection is prohibited (except in case of the genital protectors and the protectors of the teeth).
Many martial arts have systems of judgment of level of the persons who perform them, as the colour of the belts in the karate. In the same way, savate uses different colours in the gloves in order to show the level of a fighter; although, on the contrary that disciplines as the judo or the capoeira, where the fighters obtain new belts in each promotion, every fighter can use the same pair of gloves in several promotions (for that the level is not corresponding directamente with the colour of the gloves that are used but with that is established in the licence). The beginners begin without colour and the different exams of promotion permit them to be promoted to blue, green, red, white and yellow in that order. The competition is restricted for the red gloves and higher; each federation has the possibility to establish the conditions as little as possible for teaching this sport. In France, it is necessary to have the yellow glove in order to being able to gain the degree of instructor ("moniteur") and the silver glove in his technical category in order to obtain the title of teacher ("professeur"). In other lands as Mexico, all technical degrees from the green require an evaluation on subjects of helping in teaching in order to being able to increase the development of that art.

Juan Diego Flórez

Juan Diego Flórez (born January 13, 1973 in Lima, Peru) is a Peruvian operatic tenor. He is famous for the roles he sings in bel canto operas.
Juan Diego Flórez was born in Lima, Peru on January 13, 1973. His father, Rubén Flórez, was a guitarist and singer of Peruvian popular music. His mother worked in a pub where music was performed live. When a musician was ill Juan would sing instead. It was good experience for him.
He entered the Conservatorio Nacional de Música in Lima at the age of 17. He was intending to have a career in popular music. His teacher Andrés Santa María found that he had a superb voice for classical music. He became a member of the Coro Nacional of Peru and sang as a soloist in Mozart's "Coronation Mass" and Rossini's "Petite Messe Solennelle".
He was given a scholarship to the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia where he studied from 1993 to 1996 and began singing in student opera productions. He sang roles in operas by Rossini, Bellini and Donizetti. During this period, he also studied with Marilyn Horne at the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara. In 1994 the Peruvian tenor, Ernesto Palacio invited him to Italy to work on a recording of Vicente Martín y Soler's opera "Il Tutore Burlato". Palacio became Flórez's teacher and helped him an enormous amount in his career.
Flórez's first big breakthrough came in 1996, at the Rossini Festival in the Italian city of Pesaro, Rossini's birthplace. At the age of 23, he was asked to sing the leading tenor role in "Matilde di Shabran" when Bruce Ford became ill. He first sang at La Scala in the same year as the Chevalier danois in Gluck's "Armide". His Covent Garden debut followed in 1997 where he sang the role of Count Potoski in the world premiere of Donizetti's "Elisabetta". Debuts followed at the Vienna Staatsoper in 1999 as Count Almaviva in "Il barbiere di Siviglia" and at the New York Metropolitan Opera in 2002, again as Count Almaviva. On February 20 2007, the opening night of Donizetti's "La Fille du régiment" at La Scala, Flórez broke the theater's 74-year-old tradition of not having any encores when he repeated the aria "Ah! mes amis" with its nine high C's after the audience gave him an enormous ovation.
Flórez sing in concerts in Europe, North America, and South America. Amongst the many places in which he has given concerts and recitals are the Wigmore Hall in London, the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées in Paris, Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall in New York, the Palau de la Música in Barcelona, the Teatro Segura in Lima, and the Mozarteum in Salzburg. As a change from the usual music he sings, he sang "You'll Never Walk Alone" from the Broadway musical "Carousel" at the Berlin Live 8 concert in 2005.
He was signed by Decca in 2001 and since then made 5 CDs for them. Nearly all his operatic roles have been broadcast on radio or television.
Flórez was married to German-born Julia Trappe in a private civil ceremony on April 23, 2007 in Vienna. They held a religious ceremony at the Basilica Cathedral in Lima on April 5, 2008. Some of Peru's most famous people went, including President Alan García and author Mario Vargas-Llosa.
Juan Diego Flórez has won many awards and distinction, including Peru's highest honour: the "Gran Cruz de la Orden del Sol del Perú". He has even appeared on a Peruvian stamp.

<doc id="121892" url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=121892" title="Cerium">
Cerium

Cerium is a chemical element with an atomic number of 58. This means that the nucleus of Cerium has 58 protons in it. The atomic mass of Cerium is 140.12. The Chemical symbol of Cerium is Ce and it is a member of the Lanthanide group.
Cerium is a grey, shiny or lustrous metal. At room temperature Cerium is a solid. It melts and becomes a liquid at 798C and boils and becomes a gas at 3424C. It burns in air to form a compound with one cerium atom and two oxygen atoms. 0.0046% of the Earth's crust is Cerium which means that it is quite common - more common than Tin and Lead and nearly as common as zinc
Cerium was first found in Sweden in 1803 by Berzelius and Hisinger and Klaproth in Germany. Because it is very reactive, it was not purified until 1875 in Washington DC. Cerium was named after the asteroid or minor planet Ceres which was first seen two years earlier in 1801.
Cerium is not often used as a metal since it quickly reacts with the air and tarnishes. Its most common use is as the 'flint' in a lighter, because it easily produces a spark when it is struck with another metal. Cerium is sometimes used in alloys because it often makes the alloy more heat resistant. Cerium is also used in special glass, ceramics and self-cleaning ovens.
Cerium reacts in two ways to produce Cerous compounds or salts and Ceric compounds. Cerous salts have an oxidation number of 3 and ceric salts have an oxidation of 4.
Cerium has a large number of isotopes. Four of them are found in nature instead of having to be made, 
Cerium-140 (88.5% of all Cerium) and Cerium-142 (11.1%) are the most common. The average of the weights of each isotope is what give Cerium its Atomic Mass of 140.12

Hallux

The hallux, also called the big toe, is the toe innermost (closest to the middle of the body) of the foot. It is usually, but not always, the biggest toe in the body. In humans, the hallux is longer than the toes next to it; this is inherited. The disease Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva causes people to have a small hallux. In some birds, the hallux is pointed backwards to help with grabbing.

1812 Overture

The 1812 Overture (French: "Ouverture solennelle "L'Année 1812""; Russian: "Торжественная увертюра 1812 года", "Toržestvennaja uvertjura 1812 goda") (Op. 49) is an orchestral work by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. It commemorates Russia's 1812 defense against Napoleon's advancing Grande Armée at the Battle of Borodino, during the French invasion of Russia.
The Overture's first public performance occurred on August 20, 1882 (NS; the OS date was 8 August). The venue was the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow. The overture is best known for its climactic volley of cannon fire and ringing chimes. 
The 1812 Overture is written for an orchestra which uses following music instruments:
Sixteen cannon shots are written into the score of the Overture. The Overture begins with the plaintive Russian Orthodox "Troparion of the Holy Cross" ("God Preserve Thy People") played by eight cellos and four violas. The piece moves through a mixture of pastoral and militant themes. The Overture includes the Russian folk dance "At the Gate, at my Gate." At the turning point of the invasion – the Battle of Borodino – the score calls for five Russian cannon shots. A descending string passage represents the following retreat of the French forces, followed by victory bells and a triumphant repetition of "God Preserve Thy People" as Moscow burns to deny winter quarters to the French. A musical chase scene appears. Out of it, the anthem "God Save the Tsar!" appears. The overture uses counterpoint to reinforce the appearance of the leitmotif that represents the Russian forces throughout the song.
Although God Save The Tsar! was the Russian National Anthem in Tchaikovsky's time. It was not the anthem in 1812. There was no official Russian anthem until 1815.
There are several recordings of the overture in a transcription by American conductor Igor Buketoff. with the following changes and additions:

Guy Fawkes

Guy Fawkes (13 April 1570 – 31 January 1606) sometimes known as Guido Fawkes, was a member of a group of Roman Catholic revolutionaries from England who planned to carry out the Gunpowder Plot. Fawkes and the other plotters planned to kill the king, James I, and replace him with a Catholic monarch. 
5 November 1605 is remembered each year in the UK, during Guy Fawkes Night. People build large bonfires, light fireworks, and burn figures of Fawkes (known as 'the guy'). 
November 5 was the date when Parliament re-assembled after a long recess. The plot was uncovered quite late, in the night before the day of the 5th. Fawkes was arrested as he sat in a cellar, near the gunpowder, waiting for the right time to set it off. He was tortured to make him reveal the names of the other plotters. Later eight men, including Fawkes, stood trial for high treason. They were found guilty and executed by hanging in Westminster, London, except for Fawkes, who killed himself by jumping from the scaffold before he was to be hanged. Their remains were sent to the corners of the kingdom and displayed, as a warning to others. There were five other conspirators; the main man, Robert Catesby, was killed by the Sheriff of Worcester when he tried to flee.
There are many places to find Fawkes in popular literature. Here are some important examples, listed in chronological order.

The Matrix Revolutions

The Matrix Revolutions is a 2003 movie that was written and directed by the Wachowski brothers. It is the sequel to "The Matrix Reloaded".
When Neo wakes up, he finds himself at a train station. He is there because, when he used his power to destroy the sentinels at the end of the second movie, he touched the source and did not come back all the way. He is stuck there. Meanwhile, his girlfriend Trinity, Morpheus, and Seraph enter a club to talk to the Merovingian, who controls a lot of the Matrix. A gun fight ends in a Mexican standoff with guns pointed towards everyone. The Merovingian agrees to let Neo go, and Trinity picks him up.
The city of Zion is preparing for war. They pool all of their resources into a dock area. They use Armored Personnel Units (APU) to fight back. However, there are too many machines, and they soon have to fall back to the temple.
Niobe on her ship attempts to return to Zion by going through an area that only a very skilled pilot can go through. However, Niobe makes a mistake and the machines come after them. During one part of the dock battle, the commander Milfune tries to repel the machines but is overwhelmed. He dies. He tells the Kid to take his APU and to open the dock doors. The Kid does so and the ship comes through, blows its EMP, and saves the dock for now.
Near the end of the movie, Neo wants to take a ship to talk directly to the machines. Niobe turns her ship, the Logos, over to him. Earlier, Bane (who is now Smith) had stabbed a crew member and hid away on the Logos. While on the ship, Bane fights Neo and burn his eyes out. However, Neo has the power and can still see and kills Bane. As Neo and Trinity approach, the machines attack. Trinity flies above the clouds to kill the machines, but it also destroys their engines, and they lose control and crash into the ground, killing Trinity.
Neo walks up to the head of the machines, whose name is Deus Ex Machina. He says that Smith has gotten out of control and that he is the only one that can stop him. He says that he wants peace, so the machines stop attacking Zion. Neo and Smith start fighting again. This time Neo cannot beat him like he did with Bane. At the end, he says, "It was inevitable" and allows Smith to touch him and acquire him. Smith is then destroyed, as his only purpose was to balance Neo, who is now gone.

Hercules in the Maze of the Minotaur

Hercules in the Maze of the Minotaur is the fifth made for television movie based on the series "". Hercules has given up his days of traveling. He has found a place to live and be with his family. When a far off village is in danger from an unseen monster, Hercules is goes to help save the village from the monster. The origin of the monster is a combination of the Greek myth and the myths of Tantalus and Lycaon.
In a forest, two men are looking for treasure. They follow their map and find a cave covered with bushes. The two men enter the cave. In the cave, they find a large wooden door. As they try to get through the door, a monster breaks through the door. It chases after them. One man is captured. The other runs as the monster tells him to bring Hercules. At this time, Hercules is working on his farm. He sees his sons fighting and tells them that they should not fight. They says that Hercules fights. Hercules tells them that he only fights when he has to and only to stop other people from being harmed. He tells about the time when he had to fight Eryx the boxer to stop him from killing anymore people. He asks the boys if they understand. They say they do. Later that evening, Hercules is working in the stable, Zeus appears and they talk. Hercules tells Zeus that there have been no monsters for a while, which is good as he has now living with Deianeira and the children. Zeus gives him a scale from a sea serpent. Hercules remembers the time when he and Deianeira were swallowed by a sea serpent while looking for the lost city of Troy. 
At night, the children ask their father to tell them a story. He tells them how when he and Deianeira first met. Hercules begins telling how the fire had gone from the Earth and that Deianeira's village needed fire. He told them how he got the fire back from Hera's temple. During the story, Hercules sees that the children are asleep. He and Deianeira go to bed. She asks him if he misses travelling and fighting monsters. He says that he does miss it. The next day, Hercules is working in the stables. He sees something move quickly past the door. He goes to look but sees nothing. As he walks back into the stable, a man jumps on him. Hercules turns to see it is Iolaus. They begin talking about their past. The two men go inside to get a drink. Iolaus tells Hercules that he met a man who taught him to fight better. When Hercules attacks Iolaus, the smaller man does well at first. After a short while Hercules still wins. Deianeira tells Iolaus that since Hercules gave up his adventures he has become sad. A man comes at the stable looking for Hercules. He tells him that he must help his village and that a monster has taken his brother. Hercules says he cannot go. The man says he has to because he is Hercules. Later that evening Deianeria asks him why he refused to help. He tells her that he said that he would stay and raise the children with her. She tells him that he should not try to stop being Hercules, not for her or the children. She tells him to go. The next day, he and Iolaus set off for Alturia. As they travel to Alturia, a young couple are looking for somewhere quiet. They find the cave and enter. While they are in the cave, the Minotaur comes and attacks them.
When Hercules and Iolaus get to Alturia, they ask a woman where the monster is. She tells Hercules that there is not any monster. Underneath the village, the Minotaur says that Hercules will pay. Zeus appears and tells the Minotaur that he still has not learned his lesson, he replies that he has been feeding on hate. Minotaur taunts Zeus because he was unable to kill the Minotaur. Hercules and Iolaus are in a tavern. They get into a fight with some men because they do not believe that he is really Hercules. Outside the tavern, two men are killed and Hercules goes to see what happened. He is found by the villagers. They think he killed the men and chase him and Iolaus. The man who had asked for Hercules's help comes and takes Hercules to the cave where his brother was captured. Zeus appears and tells Hercules what the monster is and why he wants Hercules. He asks Hercules to kill the Minotaur. In the centre of the cave, the Minotaur challenges Hercules. They begin fighting. As Hercules is about to kill the Minotaur, the creature tells him that he is really Hercules' brother. Hercules cannot kill him. The Minotaur then attacks Hercules and Hercules has to kill him. As the Minotaur dies, he changes to his human form and Zeus tells him that it did not have to end that way. Hercules helps Iolaus and the other people being held by the Minotaur. With the people of the village now safe and Iolaus freed, the two men go back home.

Marzahn

Marzahn is a locality within the borough Marzahn-Hellersdorf of Berlin. 
Marzahn became part of Greater Berlin in 1920, as a part of the Lichtenberg district. In 1979 the large housing estate of Marzahn was separated from Lichtenberg to become an East Berlin borough in its own right and in 1986 the new Hellersdorf district (including Kaulsdorf and Mahlsdorf) was split from it. Berlin's 2001 administrative reform led to the former boroughs of Marzahn and Hellersdorf fusing into a single new borough.
In the north the locality includes the neighbourhoods of "Bürknersfelde" and "Ahrensfelde", an overbuilt strip of land which once belonged to the Brandenburg municipality of Ahrensfelde and was incorporated into Berlin in 1990.
The historic village of Marzahn was first mentioned as "Morczane" in a 1300 deed by Margrave Albert III of Brandenburg-Salzwedel, when he granted the estates to the Friedland Cistercian abbey (in today's Neuhardenberg). After the Thirty Years' War it fell to Elector Frederick William of Brandenburg.
Marzahn was the site of a labour camp (today a water treatment plant), where Roma were interned from July 16, 1936 on, two weeks prior to the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, away from visitor's eyes. As a part of the Nazi "Porajmos" extermination policy, up to 2000 inmates remained there until in 1943 they were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where most of them were gassed. In 1941 the large factory of the "Carl Hasse & Wrede" machine tool company (now Knorr-Bremse) was erected, where hundreds forced labourers were employed. The victims were buried at the nearby "Parkfriedhof", a memorial marks the site.
In 1987 Marzahn hosted the "Berliner Gartenschau" a horticulture show on the occasion of Berlin's 750th anniversary. The area today called "Erholungspark Marzahn" includes the "Gärten der Welt" (Gardens of the World) project showing a Chinese, Japanese, Balinese and Korean garden, labyrinths modelled on Hampton Court Palace and Chartres Cathedral as well as a garden of the Italian Renaissance.
Marzahn is served by the S-Bahn lines S7 and S75 at the stations "Springpfuhl", "Poelchaustraße", "Marzahn", "Raoul-Wallenberg-Straße", "Mehrower Allee" and "Ahrensfelde". Tramway connections to the inner city are provided by the "M6" and "M8" lines of the Berlin Straßenbahn.

Helicobacter pylori

Helicobacter pylori ("H. pylori") is a spiral shaped bacterium that lives in or on the lining of the stomach. It causes more than 90 percent of ulcers, which are sores in the lining of the stomach or the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine). Before 1982, when this bacterium was discovered, doctors thought that spicy food, acid, stress and lifestyle caused most ulcers. Because doctors now know that most ulcers are caused by an "H. pylori" infection, they can be cured with the correct antibiotics.
"Heliobacter pylori" was first discovered by Australian scientists, Barry J. Marshall and J. Robin Warren. They won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2005 for their work.

Schöneberg

Schöneberg is a locality of Berlin. Until Berlin's 2001 administrative reform it was a separate borough including the locality of Friedenau. Together with the former borough of Tempelhof it is now part of the new borough of Tempelhof-Schöneberg.
The village was first documented in 1264 by Margrave Otto III of Brandenburg. In 1751 Bohemian weavers founded Neu-Schöneberg also known as Böhmisch-Schöneberg, along the current Hauptstraße.
During the Seven Years' War on 7 October 1760 Schöneberg and its village church were completely destroyed by a fire due to the joint attack on Berlin by Austrian and Russian troops.
Alt & Neu Schöneberg were combined as one entity in 1874 and received town privileges in 1898. In 1920 Schöneberg became a part of Greater Berlin. Its town hall Rathaus Schöneberg was completed in 1914. Subsequent to World War II it served as the city hall of West Berlin until 1991 when the administration of the reunited City of Berlin moved back to the Rotes Rathaus in Mitte.

The movie starts with the Sirens singing "Across The Sea of Time" which is about how Zeus took the cronus stone from the titans and had a fling with Alcmene and had a son named Hercules, who defeated a hydra at an early age and became a hero. As they finish, a giant sea serpent comes from the sea and Hercules is trying to kill it. He finally throws a giant rock in its mouth but it jumps on the shore and lands on top of Hercules. It cant live on land so it dies and Hercules climbs out of its nosteral. The villagers thank Herc and Iolaus climbs out of a restchair and joins Hercules, who gets a big fish as a gift from the villagers. Herc and Iolaus head to Thebes to see Alcmene but Iolaus is a little upset because Herc gets all the credit. However the two defeat several highway men and alls okay. Saytars are in a bar and stole gold from helples people thus Xena and Gabrielle show up to beat them up and take the money back. Ares shows up after Gabrielle throws wine at a saytar and be ats him up with her fighting stick. He tells Xena to stop Herc from going to Thebes because there's a trap set for him there. Xena wants Herc to go since there's trouble and he needs to help. She is mad because Ares never gives up and wants her. She and Gabrielle argue about his intentions a little but are not enemys or nothings. Theres No rift between them in this movie. 
Hercules is acting like a horse and pulling an old style plough at his mom's house. Iolaus is tired but they see Zeus come from the heavens in his chariot winged horses like Pegasus driving the chariot down. He takes Alcmene to Mt Olympus and Hercules's pissed. Iolaus thinks Alcmene went on her own since she put up no fight but Herc disagrees and pushes Iolaus against a wall in his anger. Hercules says sorry and the two head to rescue Alcmene. Zeus talks to Ares and wonders why he did not stop Hercules. He says he tried to get a mortal named Xena to do it and Zeus is mad because Ares keeps wanting Xena. Hera shows up, Hera is an old woman with a bad attitude face and nasty voice and attitude, and yells at Zeus about bringing Alcmene here. She leaves and somehow steals the cronus stone in the moment, the stone that keeps the titans in the underworld lava pits. Hera summons the titans out while Zeus checks on Alcmene, whos been shrunk and placed in a small Arabian doll house castle for safety from Hera. Aphrodite surfs down a mountain and makes Iolaus very happy and hugs her bro Hercules. She tells Herc that Heras mad and not to go to Mt Olympus for his own good but he decides to go and Iolaus stays behind to entertain the goddess of love but she leaves when an earthquake starts. But its a small boy who falls into the lava pits. Hercules holds the colliding ends together and Iolaus pulls up the boy making both heroes. The mother takes her son as Xena and Gabrielle, in a nearby town, battle 3 thugs who they beat easily and Xena must stop a rolling giant rock from destroying the fat thug. As she is successful, they show Hercules meeting the titan Porphyion. The leader titan says Herc can go free because he is not defending the gods. Zeus calls Artemis, Aphrodite, and Ares together to fight The Titans and they hope Hercules helps them. Xena and Gabrielle are helping wounded people and Artemis decides to get Xenas help and turns Gabrielle into a giant bird. Xena flys on Gabrielle to The Gods home while Herc climbs up. Artemis says she turned Gabrielle to get Xenas help and Xena said that all she had to do was ask for help from Xena. The titans come and fight. There four big titans-Poprhyrion, Tethys, Crius, and Mnemosyne. Hercules shows up and says hi to Xena but rescues Alcmene and leaves everyone to fight the titans. Hera turns the gods into animal after. Iolaus and Xena escape via bird Gabrielle to Alcmenes house. Everyone's upset because Herc did nothing to help Alcmene. The gods are all small animals until Zeus can get the stone back. Ares is a goat, Aphrodite is a cow, Artemis is a rabbit, and Zeus is a mouse. Herc finds out that Alcmene was sick and Zeus offered to make up for hardtimes by giving her immortality and taking her to live with him on Mt Olympus. Hercules is still mad at Zeus 
The titans sing a stupid song and its back to earth where Xena sings something and both her and Hercules makeup and agree to help the gods get there home and stone back. The Titans get the stone from Hera and turn her into a small doll and place her in the dollhouse. Alcmene by the way has been turned back intoa normal person. The heroes ride Gabrielle to the mountain and fight the Titans. Herc gets the stone and tears it apart and thus the underworld caverns open and the lava pits are displayed. Hercules and Xena flip the fat titan Crius into the lave and Iolaus gets the water and fire females titans to collide and dissolve into the fiery pits. Gabrielle scoops up Porphy-rion who grabbed Hercules. Hercules managed to reach Gabrielles back where Xena and Iolaus are sitting and Gabrielle the bird drops the titan into the cavern, catches a falling Hercules, and drops him off on the gods mountain in time to close the stone which locks the titans in there prison of lava. Zeus and Alcmene go back to Olympus and Zeus welcomes Hercules to visit. Herc than heads of with Iolaus, Gabrielle, and Xena to Corinth to return a bag of gold and seek another adventure.
The songs "Across the Sea of Time", "Titans Song", and "Xena's Song" were written by Michele Brourman and Amanda McBroom.

Xena: Warrior Princess (Video game)

Xena: Warrior Princess is a "beat 'em up" video game that was released on the PlayStation in September 30, 1999, developed by "VU Games" and published by Electronic Arts, based on the .
Playing as the television series' title character, you must rescue your companion, Gabrielle, from a fate worse than death and fight the forces responsible for her capture in the first place. The game is played from a third-person perspective and revolves around slashing, jumping, and kicking your way through a series of 3D environments. Various button combinations produce special combo moves like those seen on the show, but since mashing the buttons alone appears to work well, you will not be inclined to learn the combinations. Xena can also use power-ups, which she will find along the way, as well as her trademark chakram. Once you throw the chakram, the perspective switches to that of the whirling circle, which you are able to aim, after a fashion. Once it hits something, it is propelled back. The downside to using it is that Xena is defenseless while the weapon is in the air, so you have got to use it wisely when you are under fire from archers perched up above or from multiple opponents on the ground. You use the chakram to flip switches, cut chains, and pick off opponents from a distance. These opponents sometimes become tougher targets because of the hostages they keep so near to them.

It seems that Xena and Despair (the Champion of Dahak) have both said the Talisman of Fate belongs to them. Whoever controls it will have power over all of mankind. Because of this, Xena does not want it to belong to someone who would do bad things with it. A battle takes place, but the Fates themselves decide that the only way to who should have the talisman is to have a tournament. Each of Earth's greatest heroes and villains will fight in the tournament. 
Up to four people can play. Each player controls one of the many characters from the series and tries to beat everyone else with punches, kicks, and many special moves. Xena has her sword, the Chakram, and a torch that lets her breathe fire; Gabrielle has her staff, some very good kicks, and a meditation-into-projectile attack. The game is 3D.

Auguste Comte

Auguste Comte (full name: Isidore Marie Auguste François Xavier Comte; January 17, 1798 – September 5, 1857) was a French thinker who was one from founders of sociology (from the Latin: "socius", "companion"; and the suffix "-ology", "the study of", from Greek λόγος, "lógos", "knowledge" ) and positivism. 
It was recently discovered that the term 'sociology' had already been introduced in 1780, but with a different meaning, by the French essayist Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès (1748-1836).
Comte was born at Montpellier, in southern France. After attending the University of Montpellier, one of the oldest European universities, Comte was admitted to the École Polytechnique in Paris.
He married Caroline Massin, but divorced in 1842.
He died in Paris on September 5th, 1857 and is buried at the famous Cimetière du Père Lachaise.
His apartment from 1841-1857 is now conserved as the Maison d'Auguste Comte.
The law of three stages is a socio-historical idea of Auguste Comte. Comte said that knowledge developed in three stages. The first stage is the "theological" stage, in which Comte says that people use religion or gods to explain why things happen or where things came from. The second stage is the "metaphysical" or "abstract" stage, where people use philosophy and abstract ideas to think about their beliefs and explain things. The last stage is the "positive", regarding to the three stages of positivism. Comte said that society could shift into a positivist society if the sciences, including sociology, are all used to explain things.

George Berkeley

George Berkeley (12 March 1685 – 14 January 1753), or Bishop Berkeley, was an Irish bishop and philosopher. 
Berkeley was one of the three 'British Empiricists', philosophers around the late 1600s and 1700s who believed in 'empiricism', the philosophy that everything we learn comes through our senses. The other British Empiricists included the Englishman John Locke and Scotsman David Hume.
His philosophy was called "immaterialism", or "subjective idealism". His idealism said that all our ideas came through sensations, but our senses didn't tell us anything about the world.
He said that Locke's belief in matter was wrong. He said that even though we can see, hear, taste, touch and smell, there was no way of knowing that our senses were reacting to matter, because to find out how accurate our senses were, we would need to study the very thing we use to study. Instead, he said that our experiences are caused by God, a being that is also a mind, like us, and powerful enough to create all our ideas and senses.
Berkeley was born at his family home, Dysart Castle, near Thomastown, County Kilkenny, Ireland. He was educated at Kilkenny College and attended Trinity College, Dublin, completing a Master's degree in 1707.

L'incoronazione di Poppea

L'incoronazione di Poppea () is an opera in three acts by Claudio Monteverdi. The libretto is by Giovanni Francesco Busenello. The first performance was in the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice in 1643. It was the last opera that Monteverdi composed.
Most operas in the early 17th century were about mythological stories or stories from the Christian religion. This story, however, is about something that happened in the history of ancient Rome. It is about the evil emperor Nero and how he married Poppea. The gods still play a part in the opera, especially Cupid.
Although the opera is called "The Coronation of Poppea" we do not actually see any coronation ceremony.
Monteverdi was an experienced composer when he wrote this and the opera has some of his best music. The orchestra is only a small group of instruments: strings, recorders, cornetts (an old kind of trumpet), percussion, harp, lutes and gambas. The music does not divide sharply between recitative (narrating music) and aria (set songs), but flows gently from one type to the other.
When listening to this opera it is important to remember that in the 17th century men often sang women’s parts and women sang men’s parts. A part such as Nero would have been sung by a castrato. Nowadays it can either be sung by a countertenor (a man) or a mezzo-soprano (a woman). There are scenes in this opera where the actors disguise themselves as the opposite sex. In the 17th century opera audiences did not find anything unusual about a man pretending to be a woman pretending to be a man or the other way round.
The duet between Nero and Poppea at the end of the opera may have been written by another composer. 
The goddesses Fortune and Virtue are having an argument. They are being nasty to one another, each one is saying that she is better and more powerful than the other. Cupid (the god of love) comes in and says that he is even greater than they are, and that he rules both of them. Fortune and Virtue do not dare to disagree with him.
Otho, who is Poppea’s lover, returns to his house and finds that the emperor Nero is in his house spending the night with Poppea. Nero’s guards have surrounded the house. Nero tells Poppea he has to go now, but that he loves her and will come back very soon. When he is gone, Arnalta, Poppea’s nurse, warns her that her affair with Nero will bring trouble. Octavia, Nero’s wife, is very sad that her husband is having an affair with someone else and hopes that the gods will punish him. Her nurse comforts her, saying that she ought to find herself a new lover to make Nero cross, but Octavia has too much honour to do such a thing. The philosopher Seneca tells her that she should just accept her fate. The page boy tells the philosopher he is stupid.
Nero tells Seneca that he is going to get rid of his wife and marry Poppea. Seneca warns Nero that the people will not like this, but Nero does not care. He is emperor and can do what he likes. Nero tells Poppea that he loves her so much that he wants to make her empress. Poppea says to Nero that Seneca believes that Nero is only powerful because he (Seneca) can guide him. Nero immediately believes her and says Seneca should be killed. Otho has been watching this scene. He goes to Poppea and tries to get her love back, but Poppea says she belongs to Nero now. Otho realizes that Poppea just wants power, and he knows that Nero will order him to be killed when he finds out that he used to be Poppea’s lover, so he decides he will have to kill Poppea.
Otho goes to Drusilla who is in love with him. He tells her that he loves her, but he quietly says that Poppea is still in his heart.
The god Mercury warns Seneca that he is going to die. Seneca is quite happy with the news, because it will mean that he will live with the gods in heaven. Liberto, a messenger (his name means “a freed slave”), comes to tell Seneca that Nero is going to have him killed. He is surprised when Seneca already knows. There is a short scene in which the Page with the Lady-in-Waiting. Nero, with his friend Lucan, sings in praise of Poppea.
Octavia tells Otho to disguise himself in woman’s clothes and to go and kill Poppea. She says that he will tell Nero bad things about him if he doesn’t. There is a comic scene between the Page and the Nurse. Drusilla lets Otho borrow her clothes to disguise himself. Poppea is in her garden being lulled to sleep by Arnalta. Cupid sings a song, promising to protect her. When Otho, disguised as Drusilla, comes to kill her, Cupid stops him. 
Drusilla is happy because her rival is going to die. The guards immediately arrest her thinking that she tried to kill Poppea (it was actually Otho in disguise). Drusilla realizes she was stupid to lend Otho her clothes. She tells Nero that she is guilty. Otho then speaks and tells Nero what happened. Nero punishes him by telling him to leave Rome and go and live in a faraway wilderness. Nero also sends Octavia away from Rome. He says she must be put in a boat and left to the mercy of the winds. Octavia sings a farewell song to Rome. Arnalta sings a comic song about how important he now is as the empress’s nurse. The opera finishes with a beautiful love duet for Nero and Poppea.

Kakul was historically a small village in the suburbs of Abbottabad, close to the larger Nawanshehr hamlet, which was owned by the Jadoon Pashtun tribe. When the Hazara region was annexed to British India in 1849, the then District Commissioner Major James Abbott decided to build a cantonment town which was founded in 1853 as Abbottabad; and at that time, a smaller military station or tented garrison was set up close to Kakul. In 1900-1901 this site became one of the first 'concentration camps' for Boer Prisoners of War (POWs) from the Anglo-Boer War, where some 400 such prisoners were held until 1903. In 1904-1905, a part of this camp became the British Indian Armys Mountaineering and PE Camp, whereas the rest was made into the zonal headquarters of the Royal Indian Army Supply Corps(RIASC). This position lasted until 1947, when after Independence the new Pakistan Army decided to set up the Pakistan Military Academy here, which was done in 1948.
The small township of Kakul is the capital of Kakul Union Council. The Union Council is divided into the following areas: Balolia, Kakul, Mandroch Kalan, Mandroch Khurd, Nawansher Janoobi and Nawansher Shamali.

The main tribe of Nathia Gali is the Karlal.
During British rule Nathia Gali, then part of Abbottabad Tehsil of Hazara District, was the summer headquarters of the Chief Commissioner. The town along with Dunga Gali was a notified area.
It is in Abbottabad District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province. At 2,500 m (8,200 ft) height from the sea level, it is a popular tourist resort in the summer months. It is forested with pine, walnut and also broad-leaved oak and maple trees.
It is about two and a half hours car drive away from Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan.
"Mukshpuri" and "Miranjani" are the two nearby high peaks both of which are favoured by hikers. The Mukshpuri track is wide and easy to hike. The Miranjani track, on the other hand, is a bit more difficult as it has steeper height and the track is narrow at some places. Both of these peaks could be reached within 2 to 3 hours by hiking. In case of clear weather one could catch a glimpse of Nangaparbat peak some 400 kilometres away from top of these peaks. More serious hikers also go from Nathia Gali to "Thandiani" on foot via Miranjani peak. However, the travel takes more than a day therefore proper preparation for such a trip is required. Facilities of local guides are easily available. It is advisable to acquire the services of a local guide for any hiking trip in view of the presence of wildlife in the surrounding forests.

Fibonacci number

The Fibonacci numbers are a pattern of numbers in mathematics named after Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci. Fibonacci's 1202 book "Liber Abaci" introduced the pattern to Western European mathematics, although this pattern was already described in Indian mathematics.
The first number of the pattern is 0, the second number is 1, and each number after is equal to the two numbers before it added together. For example 0+1=1 and 3+5=8.
Fibonacci sequences appear in many places in nature. Some examples of the Fibonacci sequence being used in nature are tree branches, the pattern of leaves on a stem, the fruitlets of a pineapple, the flowering of artichoke, the uncurling of a fern and the arrangement of a pine cone. The Fibonacci numbers are also found in the family tree of honeybees.

Trans-Karakoram Tract

The Trans-Karakoram Tract is an area of nearly 5,800 km² that, India claims, was transferred by a border agreement from the Pakistani-administered Northern Areas to China in 1963 with the proviso that the settlement was subject to the final solution of the Kashmir dispute. Pakistan says that it was a no-man's undemarcated border land, hence no question arises of its being transferred. The transfer is disputed by India which claims the Tract as part of Jammu and Kashmir state.
The tract, called Shaksgam, is technically part of Shigar, a valley of Baltistan region of Ladakh Province. The Raja of Shigar controlled this land until 1971, when Pakistan abolished the Raja government system. A polo ground in Shaksgam was built by the Amacha Royal family of Shigar, and the Rajas of Shigar used to invite the Amirs of Yarkand to play polo there. All the names of the mountains, lakes, rivers and passes are in Balti/Ladakhi, suggesting that this land has been part of Baltistan/Ladakh province for a long time.
The Tract is one of the most inhospitable areas of the world, with some of the highest mountains including Broad Peak, Gasherbrum and Masherbrum, and is adjacent to the highest battlefield in the world at Siachen Glacier.
