Vasectomy-behind testis.

The findings in a series of 100 scrotal dissections seem to indicate that the conventional method of vasectomy may be partly responsible for the persistent failures of vaso-vasostomy.  It is suggested that the selection of a different site for vasectomy is necessary in order to minimize the percentage of failures attending the operation of vaso-vasostomy for refertility.  Anatomically, vasectomy performed above the level of the upper pole of the testis carries some disadvantages.  There is a greater possibility of damaging the vessels.  Defining the ends of vas in relatively loose tissue calls for a wider dissection and possibly may prove more damaging when done for the subsequent operation of anastomosis.  Thus, the blood supply to both the testis and vas may be jeopardized.  The resultant scar tissue is also significantly large.  When the vas is exposed at the back of the upper 1/3 of the testis, the testicular artery has already divided into branches and left the vas.  The venous plexus is yet to form a veil for it.  The vas is comparatively better anchored in the surrounding areolar tissue.  Since in most of the cases the vas is not coiled in this region, no difficulty should be encountered, and the difficulty of anastomozing the ends of the coiled portion of the vas deferens is generally accepted when the patients comes for an  anastomotic operation at a later date.  Also the scar tissue will be less.  It is recommended that the method be used on a larger scale.

Sterilization in mainland China.

Sterilization in mainland China is becoming more popular.  In some of the provinces, the third pregnancy is interrupted and the woman is sterilized, and in others the fourth pregnancy is interrupted and the woman is sterilized.  Male sterilization is being recommended in preference to female sterilization because it is safer, easier, and less expensive.  The men are less willing to undergo the operation because they are afraid it will make them impotent or they may lose the external signs of virility.  To depress the rate of growth in China to 1% would require about 43 million sterilizations.  If the present government succeeds in this venture, the population could be lowered by 5% in 16 years' time, and at the end of this century by 15% to 20% to a total population of 560 million or even less.  Whether such a policy, so contrary to Confucian ideals and Marxist dogmatism, will be followed is questioned.

Control of fertility in the male.

Attention is given to experiments on 2 types of inhibition of testicular function.  In 1 group of studies, inhibition was brought about by direct action of an agent on the spermatogenic process with no apparent influence on endocrine relations.  In the other group, testicular inhibition was caused secondarily by the suppression of gonadotropic hormone secretion with the constant finding that the endocrine function of the testes, as well as germ-cell production, was inhibited.  Selective interference with spermatogenesis has been induced by 4 different groups of compounds: the nitrofurans, the thiophenes, the bis (dichloro-acetyl) diamines, and the dinitropyrroles.  In each case, the spermatogenic process was interrupted at the stage of the primary spermatocyte for as long as treatment was continued.  Recovery occurred following withdrawal of the drug and completely normal fertility was restored.  Pituitary gonadotropin levels remained normal and Leydig cell function was unimparied.  A variety of synthetic substances which have the capacity to inhibit gonadotropin secretion are discussed including a variety of steroidal agents, clomiphene citrate, indene and dihydronaphthalene derivatives, and a hydrazine derivative.  In each case it has been shown that gonadotropin levels in the pituitary could be markedly reduced with consequent interruption of spermatogenesis and of Leydig cell function.  These effects have been completely reversible, with both germ cell and hormone production returing to normal levels following withdrawal of treatment.  The effects of alkylating agents, heavy metals, and heat on the testes and to their possible application to fertility control in man are discussed also.

Conception control.

A review of conception control is undertaken.  The need for conception control is demonstrated with demographic evidence of population growth.  Further background on religious attitudes toward contraception is given.  A discussion of available contraceptive methods follows, including desirable characteristics, levels of effectiveness, pregnancy rates, usage, and the effect of education on usage.  Ovulation control and IUDs are discussed in detail.  Immunology is proposed as a promising area for future research.

The sexual behavior of American college women: an empirical study and an historical survey.

A ramdom sample of 49 seniors at an Eastern women's college is used as the basis for a study on the sexual behavior of college women.  The women, who were primarily from the upper middle classes, were interviewed several times a year beginning in their freshman year.  Sexual behavior was placed into 5 catagories: limited experience, restricted petting, extensive petting, intercourse confined to serious relationships, and uninhibited behavior.  Only 6% exhibited unhibited behavior.  16% had had intercourse with 1 or 2 men with whom they had ha d serious relationships.  41% indulged in extensive petting; 27% in restricted petting; and 10% had had limited experience, which is described as simply kissing.  Most of the subjects were content with their status quo.  Many experienced a liberalization of their attitudes toward sexual behavior for others during the 4-year college experience, but not for themselves.  Reasons for remaining a virgin were practical.  There was a singular lack of abstract moral or ethical considerations.  The only personality scale that related significantly to the catagories for both freshmen and seniors was the Impulse Expression scale--at the .01 level for freshmen and the .05 level for seniors.  The data presented are consistent with those of other studies which report the incidence of nonvirginity among college women to be 25% or lower.  The incidence of nonvirginity has changed little since the 1930s.  However, the incidence of female homosexuality among college women has decreased sharply since the 1920s.  It is concluded that American college students may have evolved patterns of sexual behavior that will remain stable.  This behavior consists of petting, intercourse among some engaged couples, and early marriage.

The criminality of abortion in Korea.

The wholesale importation of European laws into Korea, including the criminality of a woman undergoing an abortion, is called into question.  In order to determine Korean attitudes among the professionals involved in the maintenance and prosecution of the law, a questionnaire was sent out to physicians, judges, public prosecutors, and practicing lawyers in Seoul and Pusan  concerning their attitudes toward birth control and abortion, the criminality of abortion, and the influence of religion upo n abortion attitudes.  An overwhelming 86.5% considered birth control "very necessary."  78.6% though abortion was "sometimes necessary," and 67.5% thought that "many" abortions were being performed in Korea.  81.4% felt that abortion was justifiable for certain causes.  Chief among these were: ill health of the pregnant woman (90.1%), possible birth defect (87.6%), rape (62.8%), and single status of pregnant woman (32.2).  Religious attitudes and profession tended to influence the reason's one considered abortion wrong.  To have laws that are rarely enforced and are not supported by the people is considered bad morally as it tends to undermine faith in the legal system.  Rescinding the law on criminal abortion or revising it to permit abortion on justifiable grounds is recommended.

[Pharmacological inhibition of ovulation].

Pharmacological ovulation suppression is discussed and work on the subject is reviewed.  Chemical structure of ovulation-inhibiting substan ces and the composition of some commonly-used preparations is outlined.  The physiology (including feedback mechanisms) and metabolism of sex hormones in ovulation and of the hypothalomo-hypophyseal-ovarian system are described.  Clinical experience with Anovlar, Lyndiol, chlormadinone, enidrel, ethinodiol diacetate, and etalontin are reported, with special attention to the problems of reversibility and bl ood coagulation effects.  Sequential treatment and contraindications are discussed.  The author recommends close medical supervision, discontinuation of treatment after 2 years, use of the lowest possible doses; liver disease and the postpartum are particularly cited as contraindications.

Randomized response: a survey technique for eliminating evasive answer bias.

A survey technique for improving the reliability of responses to sensitive interview questions is described.  The technique permits the respondentto answer "yes" or "no" to a question without the interviewer knowing what informationis being conveyed by the respondent.  The privacy of the interviewee is protected by randomizing his response.  For example if all members of a population belong either to group A or to group B and the investigator wants to determine the proportion of group A individuals in the population, this information can be elicited by using the following procedures.  Before each interview, the respondent is provided with a spinner marked with a point A and a point B.  The spinner is marked off in such a way that the spinner's marker will stop at point A with a probability of p and at point B with a probability of 1-p.  When the interviewer asks the sensitive question concerning group membership, the respondent spins the spinner out of the sight of the interviewer.  The marker will either stop at point A or point B.  The respondent then indicates whether or not he belongs to the group to which the marker is pointing.  The respondent does not tell the interviewer where the marker is pointing.  Assuming that these responses are truthful, it is then possible to determine maximum likelihood estimates of the true proportion of As in the population.  The formula for calculating these estimates is provided.  Both the degree of truthfulness which can be expected from the respondents and the sample size required for given levels of precision depends on the parameter p.

Magahat pregnancy and birth practices.

Pregnancy and birth practices of the Magahats, a pagan group located in the forest area of the Southern Negros Island, are related.  The Magahats are aware that the sexual union is needed for conception.  Once the signs of pregnancy are positive, taboos are observed: these include such diverse behaviors as avoidance of eclipses and certain foods, all of which are related to some aspect of child's development which would be thwarted were the mother to participate in taboo practices.  When the pregnancy is certain, the mother of the women becomes her advisor; the pregnant woman is instructed to bath in a particular stream and is given a tonic of roots in boiled water daily during the remainder of the pregnancy.  Ceremonies, performed traditionally by the babaylan (medicine man) to counteract fears of hard delivery and to appease Apila, the goddess of pregnant women, are related.  During childbirth, the women are expected to suffer in silence, as submitting to the pain would make the woman lose face among her tribe.  The actual delivery procedure, which requires the obstetrical assistance of a babaylan, who in this role is called partera, is described in detail.  Magahatan women deliver in a sittingposition, with the back firmly pressed against a wall.  A rope is hung from the roof directly in front of the woman, and she hangs onto the rope to attain thedelivery position.  At birth, the infant is swaddled and rolled on a mat to stimulate blood circulation.  The placenta is squeezed to stimulate the child's breathing.  The babaylan then cuts the placental cord with a bamboo knife and ties it witha white thread about 4 fingers above the infant's navel.  Rituals to hastn difficult deliveries are described.  After birth, the infant is continually breast-fed until the next sign of pregnancy.

[Some elements of evaluating the problem of family planning and the fight against abortions (author's transl)].

The author presents some elements indispensable for the comparative evaluation of the problem of abortions and family planning in both small and large territories.  The past development of statutory and legal comprehensions of the interruption of pregnancy in our country, as well as the retrospective and prospective dynamic aspect of the development of this important socioeconomic and biological problem is pointed out.  A special significance is attributed to the influence of socioeconomic, psychological, and statutory-legal comprehensions in the successful fight against abortions, in which family planning, based on the principles of contemporary medical science (particularly the application of methods and means of contraception) should play a decisive role.

Health and population.

The demographic interactions of health programs, family planning, economic development and population growth are discussed.  Generally, with social modernization, a decline in birthrates follows a decline in mortality rates.  Basic medical care alleviates immediate suffering, while preventive health services contribute to long-term economic development by increasing the size and quality of the effective work force and opening up regions for development.  A dramatic improvement in health can also trigger acceptance of other innovations.  Generally, family planning field trials are more successful in countries where health and medical services have been long-established.  At the outset, it is best to concentrate family planning promotion on those who are already motivated, rather than on the whole population at once.  Factors influencing motivation include the number of living children, the family's perception of its own socioeconomic condition, and the effect of multiple and rapid childbearing on the health of mothers and children.  Simple and direct information on health, family planning methods, and access to contraceptive devices can increase motivation.  The intrauterine device seems to be the most effective contraceptive method among rural women.

The oral progestational and anti-ovulatory properties of megestrol acetate and its therapeutic use in gynaecological disorders.

Megestrol acetate alone (47 cases), combined (115 cases) with mestranol, or sequential with dienestrol diacetate, was prescribed for various gynecologic disorders or for studies of its progestational effects.  Doses were usually 1 Planovin tablet (5 mg megestrol acetate and .1 mg mestranol) for 20 day cycles, or from 2.5-15 mg megestrol acetate with or without 2.5-5 mg dienestrol diacetate.  Results of treatment were 4 of 10 permanent cures of secondary amenorrhea; 10 permanent cures of dysmenorrhea with temporary improvement in 6; 6 of 7 patients with endometriosis were relieved, although 2 had to maintain cyclic treatment after  up to 9 months continuous ingestion; 20 of 21 cases of metrorrhagia were relieved; 6 of 7 women with menopausal symptoms were improved; 18 of 21 women used Planovin successfully for contraception.  Studies with 21 women who took megestrol acetate before undergoing planned sterilization showed that neither 5 mg megestrol acetate or .1 mg mestranol alone inhibited ovulation in all women, as observed during laparotomy, but the combined  tables was 100% effective.

Tokos and atokion: an examination of natural law reasoning against usury and against contraception.

"Natural law," which has been appealed to by catholic theologians in their arguments against both usury and contraception, is examined in this essay.  Usury was "tokos" to the Greeks, while what caused contraception was "atokion."  Beyond this verbal link, usury and contraception share the bond of having both been condemned as contrary to the natural level of generation.  An act of lending is naturally sterile; an act of intercourse naturally fertile.  These 2 propositions appeared to be the chief rational support of the absolute prohibition by Catholic theologians of any profit on a loan or of any act preventing intercourse from being fertile.  The question arises as to why the argument based on nature seemed so superior; psychological and rhetorical satisfactions would seem to account for the choice.  The sacral character of coitus to which the argument finally appeals seems no stronge than the usury argument's appeal to the sacred character of time.  The claim that coitus was naturally fertile continued long after acceptance of the marriage of sterile individuals, intercourse during pregnancy, and use of the rhythm method.  The argument asserted that contraception was an evil which man could grasp.  Values dear to all people were endangered by the practice of contraception, and the argument base on nature stood for this proposition.

Photobiology of lupus erythematosus.

Ultraviolet radiation in the 2850 to 3150 angstrom range can produce abnormal cutaneous reactions and exacerbation of systemic manifestations in some cases of subacute and acute systemic lupus erythematosus. It may also be responsible for cutaneous lesions and systemic involvement in rare cases of chronic discoid lupus erythematosus--probably those with disseminated lesions. The pathophysiological mechanism producing these photobiological effects in lupus erythematosus remains unknown.

Alopecia mucinosa and lymphoma. Report of two cases and review of literature.

A total of 90 cases of alopecia mucinosa (follicular mucinosis) have been reported in the world literature since Pinkus described the entity in 1957. Alopecia mucinosa appears morphologically in any variety of three basic clinical types: grouped folliculopapules, plaque forms of folliculopapules, and as boggy nodular masses. Characteristic histochemical changes of follicular mucinosis have been demonstrated in alopecia mucinosa as well as in selected cases of mycosis fungoides and lymphoma. The majority of case reports of alopecia mucinosa have been in children and young adults (58%), and the course of the dermatosis was usually uneventful. Beyond age 40, the disease appears to behave differently in that it follows a prolonged chronic course, and of 28 cases in this category four (15%) developed into either mycosis fungoides or lymphoblastoma.

Allergy to lichens. Allergic contact dermatitis from usnic acid produced by lichenized fungi.

Two forest workers affected with allergic contact dermatitis, which occurred only during work in forest areas, showed positive patch test reactions to lichens containing usnic acid and to isolated usnic acid. Lichens are plants composed of fungi living in symbiosis with algae. Usnic acid, one of the lichenic acids which accumulates in lichenized fungi, is a monobasic acid with dibenzofuran structure and antibiotic properties. Dibenzofuran is chemically related to furocoumarans. Lichens are plentiful in temperate zone forests and allergy to usnic acid represents some part of the "cedar-poisoning" problem in British Columbia. Geographical distribution of lichens containing usnic acid suggests that allergy to usnic acid will be found to be more common than presently recognized.

Basophil degranulation induced by oral poison ivy antigen.

Seven subjects shown by patch test to be sensitive to poison ivy oleoresin were challenged with graded oral doses of ivy extract. In each instance the circulating basophil leukocytes showed significant degranulation within one hour of challenge. This finding was interpreted as evidence of the presence of immediate-type circulating antibody to ivy antigen in these subjects. No drop in the absolute basophil count was noted, but with higher oral doses the degranulation persisted for several days. Thirteen control subjects showed no change in the basophil morphology or count, indicating that the resin at these levels was not toxic to this cell. All but one of the sensitive subjects showed objective patch test evidence of hyposensitization following the intensive three-week course of oral poison ivy antigen.

Pitted keratolysis.

Pitted keratolysis is a superficial infection of the skin confined to the stratum corneum. The causative organism has not been identified. The clinical syndrome is distinct and is characterized by pits and superficial erosions in the pressure areas of the soles and in the lateral surfaces of the toes. The histopathology of the lesions is presented and world literature is reviewed. It is concluded that this disease is not limited to the tropical climates, although cases tend to be more severe in these areas.

Multiple cutaneous and conjunctival keratoacanthomata.

A case of multiple keratoacanthomata affecting both the skin and conjunctiva is reported. Although the patient was carefully studied on several occasions, the correct diagnosis was long delayed for the following reasons: (1) a history of pulmonary tuberculosis, (2) the disparity between the microscopic findings in solitary keratoacanthoma and those in some cases of multiple keratoacanthomata, (3) the unusual and heretofore unreported coexistence of cutaneous and conjunctival lesions.

Pituitary-adrenal function following topical triamcinolone acetonide and occlusion.

This study was undertaken to investigate the possible pituitary-adrenal suppressive effects of triamcinolone acetonide under occlusive dressings in six psoriatic patients. Forty-five grams of a cream containing 0.1% triamcinolone acetonide was applied daily to the psoriatic lesions of four patients and covered with an occlusive dressing. Two patients received daily applications of 45 gm of 0.01% triamcinolone acetonide cream and occlusive dressings. The four patients who received the 0.1% triamcinolone acetonide applications showed a marked decrease in the 24-hour urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids and no significant response to intravenous metyrapone testing. The two patients who were treated with 0.01% triamcinolone acetonide also showed a significant decrease in 24-hour urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids, but a partial response to metyrapone testing. Percutaneous absorption of as little as 1 to 2 mg of triamcinolone acetonide may affect pituitary-adrenal function.

Zirconium granuloma of the skin, initially seen following the use of zirconium deodorants, continues to occur secondary to the treatment of plant dermatitis with compounds containing zirconium. In our patient the reaction appeared eight weeks after initial use of the agent and has persisted for 18 months without therapy. Intradermal injection of minute amounts of a soluble zirconium compound resulted in production of a lesion that was identical clinically and histologically with the primary lesion at the end of four weeks. Although this disorder involves the skin primarily, the slight elevation in gamma-globulin level observed may be a reflection of its systemic pathogenesis.

Recent advances in the understanding of the penicillin urticarias.

The three major groups of immunoglobulins (gamma G, gamma A, and gamma M) associated with this disease are reviewed. The presence or absence of atopic disease may account for percentage variability of gamma A because reagins (skin-sensitizing antibodies) are found in this immunoglobulin. The gamma A is the antibody usually responsible for anaphylaxis, rather than the gamma G precipitins, so stressed in the past. All three immunoglobulins may be found in serum sickness, which could account for the complex nature of this type of penicillin urticaria. The merits of the immunological tests (penicilloyl-polylysine, benzyl penicillin, hemagglutination, basophil degranulation) for the detection of penicillin sensitivity are analyzed, particularly as each applies to the various types of penicillin urticaria (serum sickness, anaphylactic, dermographic, delayed dermographic, and simple chronic urticaria and the lupus diathesis). The penicilloyl-polylysine test is greatly overrated as a means of predicting possible anaphylaxis. The benzyl penicillin skin test properly performed is an excellent means of indicating this.

Ultraviolet-induced acantholysis in pemphigus.

Ultraviolet irradiation produced an acantholytic phenomenon in normal skin of seven patients with pemphigus foliaceus. In six of the seven patients, this reaction was manifested by a positive Nikolsky sign and was confirmed by biopsy in four. Friction alone, infrared irradiation, occlusive dressing, and a rubefacient failed to produce a similar reaction. The thermal burn in the skin of patients having pemphigus was of subepidermal type. Ultraviolet-induced acantholysis was inhibited by chloroquine phosphate, taken orally, in the two patients tested. Prednisone had no such effect. It is concluded that ultraviolet light is a major aggravating stimulus for pemphigus foliaceus.

Broad spectrum of leukoderma acquisitum centrifugum.

A series of diverse neuroectodermally derived tumors associated with halos of leukoderma is presented. Clinically these lesions have in common a centrally placed, usually pigmented tumor encircled by a zone of hypopigmentation. The histological findings include (1) reduction or absence of epidermal melanin, but persistence of amelanotic melanocytes in the leukodermic halo; (2) a variety of tumors including nevus-cell nevus, neuroid nevus, blue nevus, neurofibroma, and malignant melanoma; (3) variable numbers of "small dark cells" whose nature is unclear, and which probably represent in part small nevus cells and in part lymphoid cells; and (4) damage to some tumor cells which presumably could be the cause of their destruction. Also presented are histochemical demonstrations of tyrosinase activity and immunohistochemical studies for presence of gamma-globulin in the tumors. Using the fluorescent antibody technique it was not possible to show gamma-globulins in patients' sera directed against their tumors. The relationship of developing hypopigmentation to the spontaneous regression of cutaneous neuroectodermally derived tumors is discussed.

Pruritus, an uncommon but important symptom of systemic carcinoma.

A distinctive pruritic syndrome associated with systemic cancer is described. Prolonged, variably severe pruritus with a tendency to localization on the legs, upper trunk, and extensor surfaces of the upper extremities is the presenting symptom. Patients with unexplained persistent itching as herein described should be investigated for a hidden malignancy. The persistence or recurrence of itching, months or even years after apparent cure of a systemic carcinoma, suggests that destruction or removal of the primary tumor was incomplete, or that metastasis has supervened. A small carcinomatous focus may exist for many months and at times for years before clinical recognition is possible with diagnostic methods currently available.

Effect of thiabendazole on Ancylostoma caninum.

Thiabendazole inhibits nematode development before the third stage is reached. The minimum effective concentration is 0.1 microgram/ml during the first 48 hours of development and 1.0 microgram/ml at 72 hours of development. The drug has no effect on the third stage but is again effective on larvae that have undergone 72 hours of development in the intestine of the specific host (dog). Increasing concentrations of the drug seem to be necessary to kill the larvae as the organism progresses in development. Concentrations of the drug that kill the organism before it enters the third stage (infective form) are exceeded in the blood and skin of sheep by a single 50 mg/kg oral dose. It is speculated that the drug is not effective against the infective stage because it does not enter the larvae and that the larvae progress in the skin of man to a stage where they ingest the drug or become permeable to it.

Leukoderma acquisitum centrifugum. An unusual case.

A case is presented of a 9-year-old girl who developed a depigmented halo around a pigmented tumor of the skin on her shoulder. She also developed widespread metastases in the ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes, lungs, and, presumably, liver, and subsequently died of her disease. Histologic interpretations of the nature of the cutaneous tumor and axillary metastases are given and the suggestion made that the skin lesion was a malignant melanoma. Should this interpretation be correct, this case represents the first of its kind in which a lesion in a child with the clinical features of a halo nevus proved to be a fatal malignant melanoma.

Malignant melanoma arising from an intradermal nevus.

A case of malignant melanoma apparently arising from the lower portion of a preexisting intradermal hairy nevus is presented. This case is an exception to the general rule that if malignant melanomas arise from nevi they originate in nevi with a junctional component.

Bronchial carcinoid tumor with skin metastases.

The occurrence of multiple dermal and subcutaneous nodules and tumors as a significant sign in a case of a metastatic bronchial carcinoid is reported. The clinical manifestations of bronchial carcinoid often differ from those associated with the more common malignant carcinoids of the intestinal tract. It is possible that these differences might be due to an enzymatic defect in the bronchial carcinoid tumors.

Sensitivity to topically applied vitamin E.

A search of the literature has not revealed any reports of allergic eczematous contact dermatitis due to the topical application of vitamin E. A case of contact allergy to synthetically produced alpha-tocopherol is herein reported. It is felt that this is a rare event in view of the fact that this vitamin is widely used topically in this country and abroad.

Fine structure of the nevus cell.

The purpose of this investigation was to characterize the fine structure of the nevus cell and to demonstrate, if possible, a unique premelanin granule. The presence of this granule in the nevus cell would substantiate the relationship between the nevus cell and the melanocyte. Biopsy specimens of dermal nevi with and without ultraviolet light stimulation were studied with an electron microscope and the following conclusions were reached: (1) The fine structure of the nevus cell is comparable to that of the melanocyte. (2) The premelanin granule or melanosome is present in the nevus cell, particularly after prolonged ultraviolet light stimulation. (3) The nevus cell is probably an embryonal cell that can differentiate with appropriate stimuli.

Levels of antibody to Staphylococcus epidermidis in patients with acne vulgaris.

Sera from 23 patients with acne vulgaris of varying degrees and sera from 15 patients with skin diseases other than acne were tested for antibody levels to Staphylococcus epidermidis by use of bacterial agglutination and agar-gel immunodiffusion. Antibody levels to S epidermidis varied from 0 to 1:160 in both the patients with acne and in the control groups. There was no correlation between the antibody level to S epidermidis and the degree of acne. In a previous investigation it was found that antibody levels to Corynebacterium acnes are significantly increased in serum from patients with papulopustular and cystic acne. Both S epidermidis and C acnes can frequently be isolated from lesions in acne. The fact that antibody levels are increased to C acnes but not to S epidermidis may indicate that the mere presence of an organism in the acne lesion is not sufficient stimulation for antibody formation. The increase of antibody to C acnes which was demonstrated previously in patients with severe acne vulgaris may therefore reflect a direct involvement of the organism in the acne process.

Mitotic rates of rat epidermis. During growth, maturity, senility, and regeneration.

Adult epidermal tissues are renewing cell populations. Mitosis continuously provides new cells replacing those that became keratinized and ultimately shed. It seems plausible to assume that in the epidermis of growing individuals mitosis supplies cells both for cell addition (growth) and renewal. During growth, more cells are presumably retained in the tissue than become lost through desquamation. It is feasible by cutaneous incision to temporarily revert adult epidermis into a growing cell population. Presumably also during healing, cell production exceeds cell loss. What is the magnitude of cell production for renewal of adult epidermis, for simultaneous cell addition and renewal during growth, as well as during epidermal regeneration? To elucidate these problems, the mitotic rates of three epidermal cell populations (ear, plantar, and abdominal epidermis) were determined in the growing, adult, and senile rat. Further, the adult ear and back skin epidermis was converted by cutaneous incision into regenerating cell populations, and the mitotic rates were determined during healing at intervals from six hours to nine days.

"Brush" technique in animals. Finding contact sources of fungus diseases.

A technique is described for collecting specimens of hairs and scales from animals by means of a brush to help in the diagnosis of fungus diseases. The brush is then used to implant such materials on special culture media for the growth and identification of fungus organisms. This method offers a better chance to find fungus organisms than the previous method of plucking, which was like looking for a needle in a haystack. The special media makes possible the rapid diagnosis of the presence of pathogenic fungi.

Primary cutaneous coccidioidomycosis in agricultural workers.

Each of two Filipino agricultural workers experienced coccidioidal infection, characterized by a solitary skin lesion, by regional lymphadenopathy, and by a benign clinical course, without evidence of involvement of the lungs or other viscera. It is believed that these are cases of primary cutaneous coccidioidomycosis incurred under "natural" conditions. A similar interpretation seems acceptable for at least six other reported cases.

Primary cutaneous coccidioidomycosis. Reevaluation of its potentiality based on study of three new cases.

The data derived from these three young patients would indicate the need for: (1) Early recognition of the primary cutaneous skin infection as being due to Coccidioides immitis. (2) The prompt use of suppressive intravenous amphotericin B therapy until such time as local tissue resistance and systemic immunity become manifest and sufficient to contain the pathogenic fungus within the initial cutaneous site of infection as manifested by complete healing of this primary lesion and its associated lymphadenopathy. It is apparent that there is a need to reassess present concepts which have been based on insufficient data, and to revise conclusions derived from the study of the eight previously reported instances of primary cutaneous coccidioidomycosis. The traumatic cutaneous inoculation of C immitis into a previously uninfected person, contrary to earlier impressions, can result not only in prolonged illness but in serious dissemination of the disease, and in one reported instance has resulted in coccidioidal meningitis.

The genetics of incontinentia pigmenti.

The familial incidence of incontinentia pigmenti and its almost exclusive occurrence in females have been explained by two theories. One theory (Pfeiffer) suggests that the disease is due to an autosomal, dominant gene, which is sex-limited in its expression, producing the defect only in females. The other theory (Lenz) suggests that incontinentia pigmenti is due to a sex-linked gene carried on the X-chromosome. This gene acts as a dominant in females and is lethal in males. The pros and cons of each theory are discussed. The Franceschetti-Jadassohn type of incontinentia pigmenti is clinically and genetically different from the classic type. A third of "transitional" cases occurs in boys and girls. Its genetic mechanism has not yet been determined.

Nevus angiolipomatosus vs focal dermal hypoplasia.

Widespread linear hamartoma of vascular, elastic, adipose, and connective tissue was observed in two girls with another and opposite defect, that of failure of development of focal areas of dermis. No abnormality in number or chromosones was found. Multiple associated defects of development of mesodermal and ectodermal tissues were present. The fat tissue appeared to be associated with vascular proliferation in the papillary bodies and to crowd out the corium by downward infiltration of newly developed fat. Elastic tissue fibers were demonstrable crossing between the fat cells and were prominent in the superficial dermis. There was a definite stratum of dermis dividing the superficial nevus fat and the normal subcutaneous fat. This evidence justifies the explanation of the superficial fat tumors as nevoid neoplasms rather than herniations of subcutaneous fat.

Pigmented hairy epidermal nevus (Becker).

The pigmented hairy epidermal nevus (Becker) is a variety of epidermal nevus in which epidermal thickening may be minimal and hairiness and pigmentation obvious. Characteristically it is a unilateral lesion of the shoulder in males but it may affect other sites, be multiple and bilateral, and be found in women and Negroes. Histological examination may show no epidermal thickening. Nevus cells are not seen in the dermis.

Porphyria cutanea tarda induced by estrogens.

Three patients who developed cutaneous lesions of porphyrin cutanea tarda are reported after nearly a year or more of administration of diethylstilbestrol (Stilboestrol) for alleged carcinoma of the prostate. Two patients were benefited by protection of their skin from heat and friction. The third was free of lesions after discontinuance of diethylstilbestrol without protection. Two patients still show excessive excretion of uroporphyrin and coproporphyrin in the urine and feces (one a year after discontinuance of the synthetic estrogen). It is apparent that porphyrin cutanea tarda after diethylstilbestrol administration occurs only in those individuals who have porphyrin hepatica of the intermittent type or associated with some systemic disease.

Sézary syndrome. A malignant leukemic reticuloendotheliosis.

Review of the literature and the study of a case associated with a malignant lymphoma strongly suggests that the Sézary syndrome is merely a clinical variant of mycosis fungoides. Additional evidence is presented that the lymphadenopathy of the Sézary syndrome is not always of a benign nature, as originally indicated in the literature. Both the Sézary syndrome and mycosis fungoides share the unpredictability of the neoplastic processes of the reticular system which are likely to involve simultaneously or successively, the skin and the lymph-hematopoietic system, as well as the ability of the cell involved in the process to invade the blood stream, giving rise to the leukemic variety of the malignant reticulosis.

Systemic lupus erythematosus and renal transplantation. Report of two cases.

Two cases of systemic lupus erythematosus along with terminal uremia secondary to lupus nephritis are presented. Both patients were treated with renal hemodialysis and transplantation. Certain mechanical, infectious, and immunologic problems were responsible for their death. There was no evidence of resurgence of lupus erythematosus in either patient, and the transplanted kidneys did not show evidence of lupus nephritis. Renal transplantation should be considered as a last resort in treatment of patients with terminal lupus nephritis.

Penicillin sensitivity.

The results obtained in this study indicate that there are various patterns of hypersensitivity to penicillin. In order to detect these variations it is suggested that two antigens, penicillin and penicilloyl-polylysine, be employed to test for both serum and skin sensitivity. Absolutely accurate predictions cannot be made from these tests, but it is felt that their use will minimize untoward reactions of the anaphylactic type in patients thus screened for penicillin allergy.

Sensitization to p-phenylenediamine.

p-Phenylenediamine (PPD) from 0.2 mg to 1.6 mg in water or in petrolatum was applied as a patch test to 501 patients with different dermatoses, asthma, hay fever, and venereal diseases. Of these patients 10.6% reacted within the first five days indicating previous hypersensitivity and 14.4% between the sixth and the 16th day indicating the initiation of hypersensitivity to PPD by the patch application (flare-up). The reactions within the first five days were not correlated with the amount of PPD in the tests, but a statistically significant correlation was found between flare-ups and amount, so that the larger the amount of PPD the higher the frequency of flare-ups. About one half of both reactions occurred in patients with eczematous dermatitis.

Discoid lupus erythematosus. Is systemic treatment necessary?

An evaluation of fluocinolone acetonide applied topically in the treatment of discoid lupus erythematosus is presented. Bilateral comparison of 0.025% fluocinolone acetonide cream to the cream base alone demonstrated the effectiveness of this program. In 59 patients an attempt was made to control this disease with topical fluocinolone acetonide as their only treatment. Forty three patients could be controlled in this fashion. Eleven patients responded partially, but for optimal response required a systemic supplement. Five patients did not show any improvement following topical fluocinolone acetonide applications. Noteworthy, is a group of 37 patients followed through two summer seasons. Twenty-four of these patients could be controlled with topical applications but reapplication the following summer was required. Three patients in this group cleared and remained clear. Six patients followed through two summers required a systemic supplement, while four in this group did not respond to therapy.

Porphyria cutanea tarda symptomatica (PCT-S). A study of the effect of phlebotomy therapy.

The effect of phlebotomy therapy on porphyrin metabolism was evaluated in five patients with porphyria cutanea tarda symptomatica (PCT-S). The removal of 2,500 to 4,500 cc over a three to four and one-half month period resulted in a marked reduction in urine and fecal uroporphyrin excretion in three of the subjects. Clinical improvement accompanied the chemical response in each case. In one patient, the induced chemical and clinical remission has persisted for six months without further treatment.

Cancer chemosurgery (Mohs' technique). The "chemo-check".

Cancer chemosurgery (Mohs' technique) was used following curettage and desiccation of 30 unusual basal cell carcinomas as a "chemo-check" to determine if a cure had been affected. Remaining tumor was found in six of these highly-selected 30 cases. The remaining tumor was eradicated by chemosurgery. Using chemosurgery as a "chemo-check" can further reduce the small percentage of failures following curettage and desiccation of cutaneous carcinomas and thereby prevent difficult recurrent lesions.

Topical cytotoxic therapy for cutaneous cancer and precancer.

The topical application of demecolcine (Colcemid, N-desacetyl methyl colchicine), N-desacetyl thiocolchicine (Thio-Colciran), and methotrexate preferably in combination, exerts a selectively destructive action on rodent (basal cell) carcinomas, solar keratoses, Bowen's disease, and keratoacanthomas, while sparing surrounding normal tissues. The former two exert their action by inhibiting mitosis in the metaphase, and the latter inhibits the commencement of mitosis by interference with the synthesis of desoxyribonucleic acid. The cosmetic results are particularly good when the ears or nose are affected, and the cure rate compares favorably with that resulting from other treatments. Although ineffective against squamous carcinomas, the fact that this form of therapy is effective for keratoacanthomas could prove a valuable additional diagnostic point between the two in doubtful cases.

Percutaneous absorption of trivalent and hexavalent chromium. A comparative investigation in the guinea pig by means of 51Cr.

By means of an in vivo isotope technique, the so-called disappearance measurements, a comparison was made during a five-hour period between the percutaneous absorption in the guinea pig of a trivalent (chromic chloride) and a hexavalent (sodium chromate) chromium compound. Nine different concentrations of each substance were studied. We found that in the concentration interval 0.017-0.239 molar the relative absorption of the hexavalent compound was somewhat higher, but the differences were not statistically significant. On the other hand, in the higher concentrations (0.261-0.398 molar) more of the hexavalent compound was absorbed, and the differences were statistically significant. This difference in percutaneous absorption for various concentrations can perhaps account for the divergent results, in respect to the absorption of trivalent and hexavalent chromium compounds, which have recently been published.

Griseofulvin-containing medium for simplified diagnosis of dermatophytosis.

By inoculating paired tubes of standard Sabouraud dextrose-chloramphenicol-cycloheximide media, one of which contained in addition 20 micrograms/ml of griseofulvin, 86 of 88 griseofulvin-sensitive dermatophytes were recognized in 226 primary isolation cultures. Most yeast, bacteria, and mold contaminants were not selectively inhibited by the media. The method facilitates the selection of patients for oral griseofulvin therapy by those with relatively little training in mycology.

Manned space flight--some scientific results.

The paper presents the data of medical monitoring and physiological research carried out during the flights of V.F. Bykovsky, V.V. Tereshkhova and partially of G. Cooper. The results of measurements of hygienic parameters and microclimate testify to good reliability of life-support systems employed aboard the spacecraft. The analysis of the information of medical monitoring and physiological investigations allows the conclusion to be made that 5-day manned space flight causes no pathological changes. No essential peculiarities related to tolerance of flight factors by woman as compared to man have been revealed either. In conclusion the authors formulate basic tasks confronting physicians in performing physiological and hygienic investigations to promote further development of manned space flight.

Control over the cosmic radiation level during flight of space vehicles Vostok 3, Vostok 4, Vostok 5 and Vostok 6.

1. During the flights of the"Vostok"series of spaceships the radiation conditions in space were kept under operative control which comprised: a. The solar activity observation and forecasting of the solar flares followed by the appearance of proton fluxes in the near space. b. Probing the upper atmosphere with the help of balloon launchings at high altitudes. c. Direct measuring radiation level inside the "Vostok" spaceships. 2. The radiation dose received by the cosmonauts during the flights of the "Vostok" spaceships is given. Contributions of various components of cosmic radiation are considered. 3. The possibility of flights of the "Vostok" series of spaceships at high altitudes is evaluated.

Experimental measurements of the radiation hazards associated with manned space flights.

Tissue-equivalent ionization chambers of special design have been flown on U.S. satellites to determine dose-rate levels in space. A chamber shielded by 4.7 g/cm2 measured doses from energetic protons in the inner Van Allen belt and bremsstrahlung radiation produced by relativistic electrons from the artificial radiation belt formed in July 1962. In November 1962, the maximum dose-rate in space for this shield was 30 rad/hr. Behind 0.4 g/cm2 shielding, the dose-rate peak was 20000 rad/hr. These doses have been determined to be due to artificial electrons in most regions of space, masking the dose arising from energetic protons.

Procedures necessary for the prevention of planetary contamination.

Studies of microbial survival in simulated deep-space conditions have established that these conditions will not sterilize contaminated spacecraft. Likewise, data presented at this and previous meetings of COSPAR have shown that many terrestrial microbes, particularly anaerobic sporeformers, readily tolerate simulated Martian environments. Any spacecraft landing on Mars must have a low probability of harboring any terrestrial organisms, especially sporeformers, if the goals of exobiology are not to be compromised. Before the planning, production and monitoring of sterile spacecraft can be undertaken, the theory and principles of sterilization and their application to the special problem of spacecraft sterilization must be understood. The response of a given population of microorganisms to sterilizing agents is affected by several factors; these factors in turn regulate the kinetics of the killing process. The only processes that achieve both surface and interior sterilization are heat and radiation. Of these, dry heat is the agent of choice. If all parts of the spacecraft are assembled under the most rigorous conditions of cleanliness, the capsule can be brought to terminal sterilization containing a total of not more than 10(5) viable organisms. These can be killed by exposure to 135 degrees for 24 hours with a confidence of greater than 10(4). Spacecraft must be specifically designed to withstand such heat sterilization without reduction of reliability. The number of labile parts must be kept to a minimum, sterilized by methods other than heat, and inserted into the sterilized spacecraft by sterile techniques. The entire process must be under very tight control with tests and records of every detail. The sterilized spacecraft must be encapsulated and remain therein during final testing and launch until the capsule is opened in deep space. The design and production engineer must understand how all these procedures will affect the spacecraft, and the biologist must constantly monitor and educate the engineers on the scope and limitations of these various sterilizing procedures.

Response of microorganisms to a simulated Martian environment.

A study was undertaken to determine whether terrestrial microorganisms can survive in a simulated Martian environment. The ultimate objective is to establish whether earth organisms can contaminate Mars. In addition, any demonstration of survival and growth in a simulated Martian environment will provide information relating to the biology of Mars. In the experimental design, exhaustive consideration was given to the duplication of the known and the theoretical environmental parameters of Mars. These included composition of the soil and the atmosphere, barometric pressure, moisture content, solar radiation, and diurnal temperature extremes. Based upon these considerations, a simulated Martian summer environment was defined and used in the experiments. One group of microorganisms was selected from culture collections on the basis of their known characteristics. The other group was made of microorganisms isolated from soils. The soil samples were obtained from the Antarctic, from New Mexico, and California deserts, and from the Colorado tundra. The studies showed that a number of microorganisms can survive the simulated Martian environment. However, no substantial growth under such conditions could be demonstrated. The ability of microorganisms to form spores as a mechanism for survival will be discussed. Also, experiments utilizing augmented environments to establish minimum environmental conditions which will permit growth will be described.

Gulliver and Diogenes--exobiological antitheses.

Gulliver field test results in extreme natural environments are presented. A proposed new exobiology experiment, based on the detection of adenosinetriphosphate (ATP), is described with laboratory results. Significant responses were obtained from the Gulliver field tests in approximately one hour. Responses were even more pronounced when the radioactive medium was applied directly to the soil. In the new life detection experiment, the firefly bioluminescent reaction is used to assay for micro-gamma quantities of microbial ATP, a compound ubiquitous in terrestrial life. Gulliver and the ATP experiment, named Diogenes, represent complimentary antitheses in extraterrestrial life detection. The former is general and the latter specific. Theoretical considerations are proposed as guidelines for extraterrestrial life detection experiments.

Abiogenic synthesis on Mars.

Atmospheres capable of producing organic compounds under primitive conditions are discussed in the light of recent experimental evidence. The atmosphere of Mars is discussed, in particular, the observations of Sinton of reflection spectra with features at 3.45, 3.58, and 3.69, which are attributes to C-H bands and the presence of organic molecules. Colthup interprets these features as being representative of organic aldehydes and suggests specifically, acetaldehyde. Many works have considered these observations as being indicative of life on Mars. Rea has offered alternative hypotheses. This paper presents experimental evidence of yet another possible explanation; that organic compounds are being produced in the Martian atmosphere, and may be responsible for Sinton's observations. The influence of such syntheses on possible Martian organisms is discussed. Various possible Martian atmospheres have been irradiated with ultraviolet light as well as other possible energy sources and a variety of organic end products have been identified. Martian atmospheres plus acetaldehyde as a starting point have also been used and end products analyzed. Possible abiogenic pathways for Mars are discussed.

Ultra-high vacuum and microorganisms.

Experimental study of the space environment effect on living organisms is one of the most important tasks of exobiology. However location of the living organisms under study outside space vehicles and sputniks is combined with technical difficulties. Therefore it is much more suitable to reproduce conditions found in space in laboratory and to study its effect on living cells. It was proved that low temperatures, even those approaching absolute zero do not kill microorganisms. The fact of microorganisms surviving radiation of some million roentgen suggests that they would not be killed by ionizing radiation in space. UV rays should be considered as the most active sterilizing agent. The ability of microorganisms to resist high vacuum is studied much worse. Under the action of high vacuum at 10(-8)-10(-9) mm Hg during 72 hours all studied seven species of spore-forming bacilli remained viable. As for nonsporeforming bacteria under conditions mentioned, cells of some species perished (correction of parished) completely while other species retained viable cells. Conidia of fungi and parts of mycelium of fungi which do not form conidia, sustained high vacuum well.

A technique and some results of meteorite microbiological investigations.

The possibility of the introduction of living organisms on earth with meteorites is a question of interest for scientists. It is quite possible that bacterial spores can remain in an anabiotic state for a long time, thus there is no reason to refuse the possibility of microorganisms present in meteorite. A special box was constructed in order to take samples from meteorites under sterile conditions because penetration of a soil microflora inside meteorites upon their fall on the earth surface is quite possible. The sterilized rock pieces were put into soil, samples were removed at intervals and subjected to microbiological assay. In all cases different soil microorganisms were found in the central parts of the samples tested. In another study a canal was drilled in the sterile rock and meteorite samples and a bacterial culture was poured into this canal, the sample being submerged into a liquid growth medium. Cell penetration through the rock took place and bacterial growth was found in the liquid growth medium. Therefore meteorites extracted from soil not at once after their fall are hardly suitable for microbiological assay.

Carbon compounds in terrestrial samples and the Orgueil meteorite.

Meteorites contain extraterrestrial carbonaceous materials. The Alais, Orgueil, Tonk, and Ivuna meteorites resemble in their carbon, free sulfur, and non-metamorphosed mineral contents, densities, and general appearances certain organic-rich terrestrial sediments. Structural and isotopic determinations of carbon compounds in the Orgueil chondrite indicate that these compounds are primarily indigenous. Benzene extractable carbonaceous materials from Orgueil fragments and terrestrial sediments have similar chromatographic properties. Infrared and ultraviolet spectra show that they contain compounds of the same functional types. Mass spectrometric analyses of the alkanes from the Orgueil meteorite, sediments and organisms are statistically indistinguishable at the 95 per cent confidence level. Theoretical considerations and experimental data are presented which support the view that alkanes are well constituted to serve as indicators of former life. Complex alkanes in living things are structurally and isotopically analogous to hydrocarbons in petroleum. Pristane and phytane are constituents of a crude oil that is more than a billion years old. The structures and abundances of many alkanes in various sedimentary environments attest to the source and stability of these compounds. Based on the characteristics and distributions of organic substances on Earth, alkanes may provide the clearest insight into the origin of some carbonaceous substances in chondrites.

Satellite biological experiments--major results and problems.

The data on the results of biological experiments carried out on Vostok 5 and Vostok 6 are presented. Space flight factors are shown to cause in hereditary structures of some biological objects (seeds of higher plants, lysogenic bacteria, Tradescantia microspores, etc.) distortions of a small but statistically significant value. Changes in physiological functions of certain objects (seeds of higher plants, etc.) have been also detected. These data are in good agreement with the results of flight experiments carried out in 1960-1962. Prospects of research of the biological effect of cosmic radiation and weightlessness are considered with respect to flight experiments.

Results of biological experiments carried out under conditions of "Vostok" flights with the participation of cosmonauts A.G. Nikolajev, P.R. Popovich and V.F. Bykovsky.

The data are presented on a study of the effect of space flight factors, particularly of weightlessness and radiation, on the fertilization, growth and development of Drosophila melanogaster and on the mechanism of heredity in Tradescantia paludosa. Copulation, oviposition and development of Drosophila are shown to be possible under 4-day weightless conditions. A distortion in the sex ratio has been registered in the cultures of flies grown in flight. Three types of changes in Tradescantia microspores brought about by flight factors have been revealed, i.e. chromosome rearrangements, distortions in the mitotic mechanism and stimulation of growth processes in the cell. It is suggested that rearrangements of chromosomes are caused by the action of vibrations and accelerations while distortions in the mechanism of mitosis are mainly related to the weightlessness effect.

On the biological role of gravity.

The paper is dedicated to the memory of Galileo Galilei whose work is a great contribution to the development of a new branch of science--gravitation biology. Penetration of man into outer space necessitates a study of the role of gravity in the onto- and phylogenetic development of living organisms. This allows one to get insight into the biological action of weightlessness under the conditions of long-term space flight. The paper summarizes some results of the investigation of weightlessness effects in experiments on animals and during flights of Soviet and American astronauts. The rearing of animals in a special centrifuge under the conditions of prolonged action of accelerations simulating an increased gravity affects noticeably the formation of vegetative (height, weight, metabolism) and animal (vestibulo-tonic reflexes) functions as well as reactivity of the organism. Experiments employing the rearing of animals in a centrifuge represent one of the most promising methods of studying the urgent problem--biological action of increased and decreased gravitation conditions.

On artificial Martian conditions reproduced for microbiological research.

1. It is of interest to investigate the behaviour of the terrestrial microorganisms under artificial Martian conditions. This will help to verify the hypothesis concerning a possibility of life on this planet. 2. An artificial climate chamber enables one to expose microbial cells to a simultaneous effect of such factors as temperature, pressure, gas composition and insolation: a) Temperature regime is maintained automatically by means of an electronic mechanical programme device. b) A sealed chamber insures a permanent gas mixture pressure equal to 0.1 atm. c)The spectral composition of light source is close to that of the sun spectrum. d)The chamber enables to expose microorganisms on membrane filters with diameter of 23 mm or in special quartz cells of the same diameter size. 3. The preliminary experiments have shown that not all the terrestrial forms of microorganisms do survive under artificial conditions of the Martian summer.

Bacterial ecologies in limonite.

Limonite (Fe2O3 . nH2O) may be a constituent of the Martian surface. We have prepared culture media with ferric hydroxide as an electron acceptor. One medium contained ethanol, another gaseous hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Bacterial growth without light and oxygen suggests that ferric iron serves as a terminal respiratory electron acceptor. The oxidation of ferrous hydroxide may be carried out by photosynthetic bacteria. A ferrous-ferric couple may thus support bacterial respiration and photosynthesis in the absence of oxygen. This cycle may account for the dark markings of Mars.

On the biological problems to be attacked with a series of U.S. satellites in 1966.

In the opinion of interested biologists in the U.S. the search for extraterrestrial life is by far the outstanding biological task that can be undertaken with the new technology of spacecraft. And it is their hope that the bulk of the national effort put into biology in space will be directed towards the biological exploration of Mars. There are, however, many other issues that the biologist can and should pursue in orbiting laboratories, or satellites. 1) Some of these are in the areas of the cardiovascular and neurophysiology of primates, and derive their importance from the need to put man into the weightless state for prolonged durations. 2) Other questions, similarly prompted by the prospect of prolonged space flight, concern the radiation hazard. Many experiments are planned for a single satellite in which it is hoped to discover whether the weightless state significantly affects biological responses to radiation. If, as is expected, there is no synergism between weightlessness and radiation, it will be possible to pursue all other questions about radiation effects in space by experimentation on the ground. 3) Two other classes of questions that satellite experiments may answer have deeper roots in theoretical and cellular physiology. The first of these concerns weightlessness itself. A long list of experiments involving a diversity of material from animal eggs to higher plants will seek to determine whether or not the absence of a gravitational input to the system significantly affects its general performance. Special interest in the U.S. attaches to suggestions from ground based experiments that normal morphogenesis may fail in plant systems that are exposed to less than about 10(-5) g. 4) It is also hoped that satellite experiments will help resolve the long-standing debate on the cause of persistent daily rhythmicity in organisms. One school of workers in the U.S. continues to believe that such rhythmicity is caused by organisms sensing an unidentified physical variable with a 24 hr period and hence presumably caused by the earth's rotation. It is proposed to assay the persistence and stability of such rhythms in organisms orbiting the earth with a period of about 90 min. Persistence of the rhythm in such orbital conditions would dispose of the theory of external causation; failure of such rhythms to persist would, however, constitute strong though not crucial support in its favor.

The NASA Biosatellite Program.

The United States Biosatellite Program includes critical and sophisticated experiments to study the effects of weightlessness and decreased gravity at the cellular, tissue, organ, and organism levels during orbital periods of 3 to 30 days. The experiments involve a wide variety of plants and animals from single-celled organisms to primates. The effects of weightlessness combined with a known source of radiation will be studied to determine if there are any antagonistic or synergistic genetic or somatic effects on various organisms. Experiments are included to study the effect of removal from the Earth's rotation in relation to biological rhythms of organisms. The experimental test organisms have been exposed to the simulated dynamic forces of launch and flight profiles.

[Progressive decrease of the causes that maintain ventricular fibrillation after experimental coronary occlusion].

Progressive diminution of the causes that maintain ventricular fibrillation after coronary occlusion. Extracorporeal circulation was performed on a group of normal dogs in which a ligature was placed on the left anterior descending coronary artery, immediately beneath the bifurcation of the left coronary artery. The incidence of ventricular fibrillation was of 15 dogs out of 20 (table 1). In a control group without extracorporeal circulation ventricular fibrillation appeared in 24 dogs out of 30 (table 2). These results demonstrate that extracorporeal circulation performed with the idea of improving coronary circulation does not prevent ventricular fibrillation in coronary occlusion. In those dogs with the cross circulation, attempts to defibrillate the ventricles with an electric a.c. defibrillator (three electrical shocks applied directly on the myocardium every 4 or 5 minutes) were uniformly unsuccessful until a period ranging from 12 to 80 minutes elapsed after the onset of ventricular fibrillation. After these periods all fibrillating dogs were defibrillated and recovered either normal or idioventricular rhythm. It is assumed that a "fibrillator substance" liberated by the injury in the initial state of infarction is washed out of the myocardium, or a zone of increased excitability and conduction disturbance is progressively eliminated so that the chances of originating circus movements are diminished.

[Study of PBI 131 urinary elimination and collection located in breast carcinoma with or without metastasis].

In 9 female patients with breast cancer, we studied the diagnostic uptake of I131 at 24 hours, localization of I131 in the thyroid, primary breast tumor and its metastases, urinary excretion of I131 at 24 hours and PBI131, and came to the following conclusions: 1. Low normal values for uptake at 24 hours was observed as in previous studies. 2. There was no I131 uptake in the primary breast tumor or its metastases. 3. The sum of 24 hour uptake levels plus the urinary excretion at 24 hours were within normal limits. 4. Therefore, the relatively low uptake figures, which were repeatedly observed in these patients, are not due to competition between the thyroid uptake of I131 and the neoplastic tissue.

[Comparison between the bacterial flora airways and of the lung tissue].

In 44 patients tracheotomized and under mechanical ventilation bacteriological studies were carried out, inmediately after death, in bronchial secretions and in a small piece of lung obtained by thoracotomy. The more frequently found bacterium in bronchial secretions or the lung was the Pseudomona aeruginosa (Table 1). In order of decreasing frequency: Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, Proteus, etc. were found in the lung while in bronchial secretions the order was inverse by predominance of Proteus. Total bacteriological coincidence was found in 14 cases while it was partial in 8 more patients where another bacterium was added in bronchial secretions. Bacteria were different in 6 cases (Table 2) in 4 of them: staphylococcus was obtained in the lung while Pseudomonae, Proteus and Klebsiellae were present in bronchial secretions (Table 3). In 16 cases cultures of the piece of lung taken were negative. Not taking into account these last ones, it is possible to conclude that from the therapeutic stand point culture of bronchial secretions was useful in antibiotic selection in 22 out of 28 cases.

[Immunologic phenomena in guinea pigs injected with homologous ganglia extracts].

Immunological modifications in guinea pigs injected with homologous lymph node extracts. In studies carried out in patients with lymphomas an accentuation of the B2M-globulin line was observed; occasionally paraproteins and isoantibodies were detected. For this reason the authors decided to find out whether the injection of homologous lymph node extracts in guinea pigs would produce serum, immunological and histological modifications comparable to the ones observed in the human being. A total of 100 guinea pigs were divided into 4 groups. Group 1, 50 untrated control animals; Group 2, 10 animals injected with complete Freunds adjuvant every 10 days, for 3 times, and sacrificed 7 days after the last injection; Group 3, 10 animals injected with the antigen prepared with the lymph nodes from normal guinea pigs, in the same way as the preceding group; Group 4, 30 animals injected with the same antigens emulsionated with the adjuvant, again by the same method as the 2 preceding groups. The antigen was prepared with the lymph nodes from normal guinea pigs. The cells were "ultrasonicated" and lyophilized; the lipids were extracted with chloroform. The extract thus obtained contained an average of 2 mg/ml of total proteins. A microimmunoelectrophoretic study (MIE) against rabbit immuno serum for guinea pigs anti-serum proteins, showed that it was contaminated with various serum proteins (fig. 1, A). In the 3 injected groups, most of the guinea pigs showed a 10% decrease in serum protein (Table). Using MIE there was a re-enforcement of the B2M-globulin precipitation line (IgM), in all the animals of groups 2 and 4, as compared to the groups 1 and 3 (Table and figure 1. B and C). Using microdiffusion in agar, the serum of 6% of the guinea pigs of group 4 gave precipitation lines with the homologous antigen (Table, figure 1, D). Using passive hemagglutination, between 30 and 40% of the serum of the animals of all 4 groups gave positive results with the same antigen, with a low titer (1/40). Using complement fixation, positive results were obtained with the lymph node antigen in 10% and 20% of the animals of groups 3 and 4 respectively: from 25 to 50% fixation with a titer of 1/10 (Table). Using immunofluorescence, positive images in the cytoplasm of lymphocytes (from improntas of normal guinea pigs lymph nodes) were obtained only in the labeled gamma-globulin (IgG) of the animals of group 4 (Table and figure 2, C). Histological study of the lymph nodes of guinea pigs from groups 2 and 4 showed hyperplasia of the reticular tissue with apparent decrease in the size of the follicles. In some of the lymph nodes of the animals of group 4, giant cells were observed (Fig. 2, B), pironinophilic. In the group 3 hypertrophy of the lymphoid follicles was observed (fig. 2, A). Non-specific modifications of the serum proteins, similar to the ones observed in patients with lymphomas were detected in some of the animals belonging to groups 2 and 3 in a greater number of animals in group 4. Circulating isoantibodies could be compared to those detected in 2 cases of lymphosarcoma. In spite of definite histological alterations of the lymphatic organs, these cannot be compared with the alterations detected in the human being.

[Anatomoclinical study of pulmonary embolism in patients with or without pulmonary infarction].

The autopsy protocols of 560 patients were studied in order to detect the incidence of pulmonary embolism, 83 cases were found (15%). The clinical data was analyzed to establish the existence of differentiating points between subjects with pulmonary infarcts and those with embolism but without infarction. The necropsy findings were further scrutinized to determine the effect of the anatomic localization of the embolus upon the production of infarction. Pulmonary infarctions were present in 60% of the cases with pulmonary embolus. The presence of cardiac failure, valvular heart disease and left ventricular hypertrophy was significantly more frequent in patients with pulmonary infarcts. In subjects with or without infarction the age, sex and the presence of medical debilitating diseases, recent trauma, surgical interventions or postpartum, cardiac diseases, arteriosclerotic heart disease, clinical evidence of thrombophlebitis, prolonged bed rest and atrial fibriliation preceding the pulmonary embolism, did not evidenciate any significant difference. In the cases with infarction the pulmonary embolus was significantly more frequently located in the small and sublobar pulmonary artery branches, while when pulmonary infarction was not found the embolic process was more frequently located in the main, right or left pulmonary arteries; occlusion of the lobar arteries had approximately the same incidence in the two groups. The most common clinical signs of pulmonary thromboembolism were dyspnea, tachycardia, cough and shock. The presence of hyperthermia, cough, jaundice, bloody sputum, pleuritic pain, pleural friction rub and pleural effusion was significantly more frequent in those cases with pulmonary infarction; the last five features were present only in the presence of infarction. The electrocardiogram was strongly suggestive of pulmonary embolism in the 6% of all cases, while the chest X-ray in 30% of those with pulmonary infarct. The diagnosis was established antemortem in 40% of the cases with infarction and in 20% of the cases with embolus but without pulmonary infarction. In 23% adequate anticoagulant therapy was established.

[Clinical and phonocardiographic considerations about ejection sound].

The clinical data of 38 patients in whom an added sound at the beginning of the ejection phase was demonstrated in the phonocardiogram, are reviewed and compared with the x-ray picture, the electrocardiogram and in 7 cases with hemodynamic studies. In 28 of these patients, the systolic click was more intense at the apex or at the aortic area, while in the other 10 cases, it was more easily detected at the pulmonary area. In the first group we found 13 patients with aortic insufficiency, 2 with aortic stenosis, 8 with arterial hypertension, 3 with marked aortic atherosclerosis, 1 cases of coartation of the aorta an 1 patient with aortic dilatation of unknown origin. The second group was composed by 4 cases of mitral stenosis, 3 patients with chronic cor pulmonale, 1 with subacute cor pulmonale, 1 case of valvular pulmonary stenosis and 1 case of Eisenmenger's Syndrome with persistence of the ductus arteriosus. A feature common to all cases was the finding of marked dilatation of the aorta or the pulmonary artery. The problems in differential diagnosis with the splitting of the first heart sound and with the auricular sound are analyzed and the possible pathogenic mechanisms discussed, emphasizing the role of the dilation of the main vessels during ventricular ejection.

[Polycystic hepatic and renal disease with portal hypertension and ascites (a case report)].

The case of a 50 years old man with polycystic liver and kidneys and ascites which had been diagnosed by laparoscopy and pyeloureterography, is reported. Chronic renal failure was the cause of death, and obvious signs of portal hypertension were found at necropsy. The loss of hepatic structure produced by pericystic fibrosis, regenerative nodules, thrombosis of portal branches, and necrotic areas, is stressed as an important cause of portal hypertension. This pathogenesis could be similar to that of cirrhosis. Both portal hypertension and ascites are highly uncommon facts in adults' polycystic livers.

The Cornelia de Lange syndrome: clinical and cytogenetic interpretations.

A euploid/aberrant double stem line mosaicism was found in two cases of the de Lange syndrome with severe abnormalities. In both cases the structural heterozygosity of the aberrant stem line involved, apparently, the loss of chromosomal material from a smaller autosome of Group (6-12) X, probably No. 11. Differences in the cultural characteristics of de Lange cells suggest that the aberrant stem line may not proliferate in culture, so that mosaicism may not be detected. Moreover, the mosaicism may not be present in all tissues, resulting in normal cytogenetic findings as noted in a third case studied. Our findings suggest that the de Lange syndrome is the phenotypic expression of chromosomal mosaicism.

Histoplasmosis and thrombocytopenic purpura: transmission by renal homotransplantation.

Two patients with disseminated histoplasmosis are reported. One patient presented with severe thrombocytopenic purpura and splenomegaly. Histoplasmin skin test, blood and bone marrow cultures and smears, sputum cultures, and chest radiographs were negative for Histoplasma capsulatum. She died on the sixth hospital day from a massive intracerebral hemorrhage. Cardiorespiratory function was maintained until one kidney was removed for homotransplantation. The second patient, with chronic glomerulonephritis and uremia, received the renal homograft from the first patient. Initial signs of homograft rejection developed five days postoperatively. Diffuse thrombocytopenic purpura occurred shortly thereafter. Spores of Histoplasma capsulatum were observed in blood smears, in leukocyte concentrates, and in five-day leukocyte cultures from the blood obtained prior to death. Disseminated histoplasmosis was found in both patients at autopsy. The severe platelet deficit in both cases suggests that systemic histoplasmosis should be considered as a cause of thrombocytopenic purpura.To our knowledge, this is the first reported instance of direct transmission of Histoplasma capsulatum, and must be considered a hazard in homotransplantation.In vitro leukocyte cultures as a method for early diagnosis of certain disseminated fungous infections needs further investigation.

Admissions to a provincial psychiatric hospital: the effects of opening a second in-patient facility.

Until 1955, the Saskatchewan Hospital, North Battleford, was the only facility designated for in-patient psychiatric treatment of the northern half of Saskatchewan's population. In that year the University Hospital's 39-bed psychiatric unit was opened in Saskatoon, but the number of Saskatoon patients referred to North Battleford have continued to increase.A statistical study of changes in the annual admission rates (patients/1000 population) to the Saskatchewan Hospital shows that the opening of the University Hospital unit has reduced the rate of intake of Saskatoon residents to the Saskatchewan Hospital. This decrease is related to specific diagnostic groups. There have also been changes in methods of referral.

Male sterilisation: its aspects and effects.

Nonappliance and appliance methods of contraception, together with abortion, serve as means of spacing rather than limiting the number of children couples have.  Only sterilization limits population.  There are various problems with sterilization that have to be dealt with in order to make it a more effective and trusted method.  Some of these problems are: 1) infection following the operation; 2) faulty or incomplete instructions given as to limitations and possibility of existing sperm after the operation; 3) poststerilization pregnancies; 4) decreases in sexual  satisfaction following sterilization; and 5) fears of impotency.

Immunoglobulin structure: partial amino acid sequence of a Bence Jones protein.

Sequence analysis and ordering of the soluble tryptic peptides of one Bence Jones protein and comparison with partial sequence data for another have revealed many structural differences in the half of the molecule with the terminal amino group, but only one structural difference in the half of the molecule having the terminal carboxyl group. Somatic chromosomal rearrangements may effect such changes and account for variability in antibody structure.

Turnover of ribosomal RNA in rat liver.

After a single injection of radioactive orotic acid and a "chase" of nonradioactive precursor, the specific activity of ribosomal RNA in rat liver decreases logarithmically at a rate corresponding to a half-life of about S days. The possible significance of this result is discussed with regard to control of protein synthesis.

Cystathioninuria: nature of the defect.

A homogenate of liver obtained by biopsy from two patients with cystathioninuria, an inborn error of metabolism, cleaved radioactive cystathionine only slightly until an excess of pyridoxal phosphate was added. The apoenzyme failed to bind the coenzyme normally. Pyridoxine therapy of familial cystathioninuria thus has a sound basis.

Inhibition of protein synthesis by spectinomycin.

Spectinomycin selectively inhibits protein synthesis in cells and in extracts of Escherichia coli. Mutations to high-level resistance to this antibiotic map close to the streptomycin locus, and the site of action of spectinomycin, like that of streptomycin, is the 30S ribosomal subunit, as shown by experiments with reconstituted 70S ribosomes containing subunits from sensitive and from resistant ribosomes. In contrast to streptomycin, however, spectinomycin is not bactericidal and causes no detectable misreading of polyribonucleotides.

Lability of host-cell DNA in growing cell cultures due to Mycoplasma.

In HeLa-cell cultures chronically infected with Mycoplasma, (PPLO) host-cell DNA is unstable as detected by incorporation of H(3)-or C1 i-thymidine into DNA and subsequent release into the medium as acidsoluble radioactivity. This characteristic can be transmitted to PPLO-free cultures of strain L cells by inoculation with preparations of PPLO from the HeLa cells, although chronically infected cultures of L cells continue to multiply. In addition, virus preparations also may carry PPLO contamination through numerous passages.

Nucleoside incorporation into strain L cells: inhibition by pleuropneumonia-like organisms.

Contamination of Strain L cell cultures by pleuropneumonia-like organismtis (PPLO) resulted in a complete inhibition of the incorporation of tritiated thymnidine and uridine. Contanminated cultures were characterized by a concentration of PPLO along the margins of the cells and in the intercellular-spaces of the cultures. Autoracliograins of PPLO-contaminated cultures were characterized by exposed silver grains over the margins of the cells. Kanamnycin was efjective in the elimination of PPLO and the restoration of nucleoside incorporation.

Protein synthesis by ribosomes from heart muscle: effect of insulin and diabetes.

Incorporation of phenylalanine into protein by ribosomes from the heart muscle of rats is decreased when the ribosomes are from alloxan-diabetic animals. Protein synthesis is increased when the ribosomes are obtained from nondiabetic animals I hour after treatment with insulin. The change due to insulin appears to be an alteration in the function of the ribosome.

Ultraviolet damage to bacteria and bacteriophage at low temperatures.

The survival of Escherichia coli B/r WP2 (tryptophan-requiring) from ultraviolet irradiation when suspended in 0.067M phosphate buffer (pH 7) has been studied over the temperature range 22 degrees to -269 degrees C. In unfrozen suspensions there was no appreciable change in sensitivity between 22 degrees and -10 degrees C. The sensitivity in the presence of ice progressively increased by a factor of 7 when the temperature was lowered to -79 degrees C. Between -79 degrees and -196 degrees C the sensitivity decreased to less than four times the sensitivity at 22 degrees C and was not appreciably different at -269 degrees C. Evidence from experiments with bacteriophage T1 and E. coli WP2 HCR(-) (a strain unable to excise thymine dimers) indicates that a new, qualitatively different lesion, less amenable to repair, may replace the thymine dimer in E. coli irradiated at -79 degrees C.

Induction in vitro of antibodies to phage T2: antigens in the RNA extract employed.

Cells from rat peritoneal exudate incubated in vitro with phage T2 yield RNA which induces cultures of rat lymph nodes to form antibodies. Complement fixation reveals T2 head, tail, and internal protein antigens in the RNA. Inoculating the RNA into mice that had previously been stimulated primarily with whole phage T2 results in a secondary response of neutralizing antibody.

Induction of tumors in hamsters with an avian adenovirus (CELO).

When newborn hamsters were inoculated subcutaneously with chicken-embryo lethal orphan virus, tumnors developed at the site of inoculation in 23 out of 69 hamsters within 88 to 195 days of inoculation. These tutlnors and tissue cultures, prepared from a primary tumor, were transplantable to newborn and weanling hamsters. The primary tumnors and tissue cultures of a primary tumor were free of demnonstrable infectious virus. The virus is the first "nonhuman" adenovirus found to induce tumors in hamsters.

Dorsal spinocerebellar tract: response pattern of nerve fibers to muscle stretch.

The response to muscle stretch of second-order neurons of the dorsal spinocerebellar tract was studied in anesthetized cats. Three different types of neurons are defined; the response of each type is remarkably similar to that of the corresponding stretch-receptors of the muscle. Accordingly, the cerebellum receives information on the mechanical situation in muscle from three qualitatively different channels: one has a high degree of sensitivity to dynamic stretch (Ia units) and provides a mixed signal of muscle length and speed of movement; another provides information mainly on muscle length (group-Il units); and the third signals information on the degree of contraction of the muscle (Ib units).

DNA: reaction with chloroquine.

Diflerence spectrophotometry shows that double-stranded DNA produces mnarked changes in the absorption spectrum of chloroquine; only minor changes occur with single-stranded DNA. A DNA-chloroquine complex was demonstrated to sediment in the analytical ultracentrifuge. Chloroquine strongly elevated the thermal dissociation temperature, T(m), of DNA. It is concluded that the drug forms a complex with DNA by ionic interaction and stabilizes the helix.

Color-discrimination performance of pigeons: effects of reward.

Performance of two pigeons given tasks in discriminating colors was examined on trials before and after they had occasionally received rewards for pecking when exposed to light of specific wavelengths. After a reward, the probability that the birds would respond to light svtimuli that were never rewarded was higher than before the reward was given, but paradoxically the birds showed no general decline in their ability to differentiate between stimuli at wavelengths 1 millimicron apart.

A brief temporal gradient of retrograde amnesia independent of situational change.

Rats were given a single electroconvulsive shock at varying intervals after receiving a punishing shock to the feet immediately after stepping into a compartment. Significant amounts of retrograde amnesia for the memory of the punishment was shown when electroconvulsive shock was administered up to and including 30 seconds after the punishment but not at 60 seconds. This brief temporal gradient cannot be explained in ternis of changed stimulus cues or learned interference analogouS to retroactive inhibition.

Occurrence of well-preserved rod-shaped and coccoid bacteria in the Precambrian Gunflint chert (1.9 x 10(9) years old) has been demonstrated by electron microscopy. This appears to be the oldest definite occurrence of bacteria in the fossil record. The organisms are morphologically comparable with certain modern iron bacteria.

Nuclear mitochondria?

Recognizable mitochondria were detected in the nucleus of a leukemic cell. It is suggested that passage through enlarged nuclear pores, incorporation within a pinched off invagination, or inclusion within the nuclear envelope at telophase may have been responsible for this unusual event.

Mercurial-induced transformation of myosin prevented by adenosine triphosphate and pyrophosphate.

Adenosine triphosphate and pyrophosphate prevent the loss of Ca(//)-activated adenosine triphosphatase activity caused by high concentrations of mercurial sulfhydryl reagent. They concomitantly prevent the transformation of myosin into faster-sedimenting products. This is adduced as support for the hypothesis that the strategic sulfhydryl group is not binding adenosine triphosphate at the active site, but is initiating a conformational change upon its reaction with the mercurial reagent.

Role of orbital cortex in regulation of thalamocortical electrical activity.

The orbital region of the cortex in the cat is essential to the occurrence of spontaneous spindle bursts and thalamically induced recruiting responses, observed in both cortex and thalamus. Ablations of the entire dorsal convexity, and of the mesial and cingulate regions of the cortex, failed to interfere with the spindle bursts and recruiting responses, whereas ablations confined to the orbital cortex alone abolished completely these potentials in the cortex and thalamus. Therefore, the orbital cortex appears to be the only region of the neocortex to play a crucial role in the regulation of thalamocortical synchronizing and integrating functions. These functions are believed to be associated with a nonspecific system governing internal inhibition which manifests itself in inattention, drowsiness, and sleep.

Solar distillation of water from soil and plant materials: a simple desert survival technique.

Water obtained from soil and plant materials by a simple distillation technique can provide a means for survival under desert conditions. A hemispherical hole in soil (in some cases containing cut plant material) is covered with plastic film formed and held in a conical shape by a rock placed in the center. Water collects on the under side of the plastic, runs to the point of the cone, and drops into the container. A yield of 1.5 liters per day of potable water was obtained from a single "survival still."

Sarcolemma: transmitter of active tension in frog skeletal muscle.

Maximumn tetanic tension developed by frog muscle fibers was measured before and after they had been injured at one end so as to break myoplasmic continuity but to leave the sarcolemma-tube connection to the tendon. The lateral mechanical coupling between myoplasm and sarcolemma is adequate to bear and transmit the maximum active tension developed during stimulation.

Iodination in relation to thyroglobulin maturation and subunit aggregation.

Noniodinated subunits of thyroglobulin can aggregate, but iodination of the aggregate is required for its stabilization (maturation). Rat-thyroid slices incorporate amino acids into subunits, but cannot form mature thyroglobulin from the newly synthesized subunits. This defect leads to an accumulation of 16S and 12S proteins, although the preexisting thyroglobulin is 19S. Accumulation of 16S and 12S proteins can be produced in rat thyroids by the administration to the animals of a thiocarbamide derivative, methimazole. Upon withdrawal of methimazole, iodination of the 16S and 12S proteins proceeds, and 19S protein appears.

Fluorescent contaminants from plastic and rubber laboratory equipment.

Plastic and rubber laboratory apparatus contains materials that are extractable with water, aqueous solutions, and nonaqueous solvents. These extractable substances fluoresce under ultraviolet light and were found as contaminants in nutrient solution used for growing excised lemon fruit tissue in vitro. The source of these fluorescent contaminants has been removed by using all-glass laboratory equipment.

Lymphocytes of small mammals: spontaneous transformation in culture to blastoids.

Small lynmphocytes froni rabbit and guinea pig, grown in tissue culture in the absence of phytohemagglutinin, can transform spontaneously into cytologically immature cells that are indistinguishable morphologically from blast cells. The transformation occurs in 38 to 75 percent of peripheral lymphocytes and 55 to 75 percent of splenic lymphocytes on the 5th day of culture. The altered cells can synthesize RNA and DNA and show mitotic division; synthesis of DNA occurs after the 5th day of culture, whereas RNA is synthesized throughout the duration of culture.

Kinetin-induced chloroplast maturation in cultures of tobacco tissue.

Cultured tobacco tissue possesses proplastids capable of differentiating into mature chloroplasts. Kinetin (6-furfurylaminopurine) is a specific requirement for this differentiation; the absence of this compound results in a blockage of the formation of grana. The possibility that kinetin exerts a direct effect upon chloroplast differentiation is considered.

Prostaglandin: release from the rat phrenic nerve--diaphragm preparation.

Release of a substance that stimulates smooth muscle was detected from a phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparation from the rat upon direct and indirect stimulation. On thin-layer chromatography most of the active material behaved as a mixture of prostaglandins. The effect of electrical stimulation was mimicked by catecholamines but not by acetylcholine or eserine. The effect of nerve stimulation was not antagonized by d-tubocurarine.

Arterial hypertension elicited by subpressor amounts of angiotensin.

Long-term infusion of amounts of angiotensin insufficient at the beginning to raise arterial pressure results, after several days in sustained arterial hypertension in unanesthetized dogs. This hypertension is to a large degree dependent on environmental stimuli, and results chiefly from increase in peripheral resistance. As in dogs with renal hypertension, there is increased pressor responsiveness to tyramine. This indirect action of angiotensin to increase total peripheral resistance and arterial pressure by an action on the sympathetic nervous system, along with an upward resetting of the carotid sinus buffering mechanism, might logically account for the neural component of chronic renal hypertension. Such a proposal integrates the humoral and neural elements of the mosaic describing the mechanisms of tissue perfusion.

Hemolysin production in the development of staphylococcal lesions.

The presence of hemolysin in staphylococcal lesions of the rabbit kidney was detected by overlaying sections of kidney with blood agar. Hemolytic activity against rabbit, human, sheep, calf, and guinea pig erythrocytes was present and was not abolished by heating the sections to 60 degrees C for 30 minutes. In developing lesions, hemolytic activity appeared before necrosis or exudation.

<doc>
The medical care of older patients.

Proper medical care for growing numbers of older people depends upon application of advances in medicine to the special problems of ageing. Despite gaps in understanding of the ageing process, high-quality care can be achieved through routine use of knowledge already available.Older people differ structurally, functionally and psychologically. Health influences every aspect of their lives. Their reactions to stress and disease are altered. In practice, the doctor must assess the biological changes of ageing and their possible influences on symptoms and signs. Modifications in the application of ordinary methods of medicine and surgery are determined by functional impairments and structural defects. While the medical problems of the aged are special, the approach must be general; the practitioner needs experience with disease in all age groups and should be alert to the adverse effects on old people of the universal misunderstandings of ageing and its problems.

</doc>
<doc>
Psychiatric aspects of ageing.

Psychotic conditions due to structural brain disease of the senile and arteriosclerotic type are numerically less important than was formerly assumed. They account for about 25-30% of the psychiatric illnesses of the aged. Functional psychoses, particularly endogenous depressions, form an important part of these disorders. Their symptomatology and treatment are not essentially different from those of functional psychoses in the younger age groups. Among non-hospitalized old people, neurotic conditions represent the most frequently encountered type of mental disorders. Psychodynamic factors, operative in the older as well as the younger generations, and their interplay are responsible for the neurotic conditions of the elderly. These respond favourably to psychotherapy. Severe acute and subacute confusional states are caused in some aged people by physical and psychological stresses. These conditions have a serious prognosis but are amenable to proper treatment when diagnosed in time. They are the responsibility of the general practitioner and the general hospitals.

</doc>
<doc>
Rehabilitation of the aged.

The rehabilitation needs and goals of older people differ in many respects from those of the young. In younger individuals a crippling condition may affect an otherwise healthy body, while in an older person it may be superimposed on other pre-existing degenerative diseases. Thus, in older patients the restorative or rehabilitative phase rarely can be separated from the phase of definitive medical treatment.The primary goal of rehabilitation of younger individuals is usually vocational. In the older group this goal or objective is, by and large, secondary. This does not minimize, however, the value of medical and social services in the rehabilitation of older persons. The simple ability to care for his own personal needs can do much to help the elderly disabled patient regain his dignity and self-respect and remove his fears of becoming a burden on his family or society.

An attempt was made to assess the effect of an anabolic hormone in the postoperative phase. Methandrostenolone (Danabol) was given to groups of adults and children undergoing open-heart surgery, and the results were compared with those obtained in control groups. No difference in the clinical picture could be found between the treated and the untreated groups, or in the total amount of nitrogen excreted during six days following the operation. In both treated groups the urinary volume was increased, resulting in a decreased urinary nitrogen concentration.

A controlled field trial of the effectiveness of cholera and cholera El Tor vaccines in the Philippines. Preliminary report; Philippines Cholera Committee.

In a controlled field trial on some 584 000 people in an endemic cholera El Tor area in the Philippines, it was demonstrated that cholera vaccines gave moderate protection of short duration. Injection of a single dose of vaccine prepared from either Vibrio cholerae or Vibrio El Tor gave over 50% protection for the first two months. The immunity conferred by the V. cholerae vaccine rapidly declined after three to four months. The V. El Tor vaccine gave protection for six months, but its effectiveness declined. An oil-adjuvant vaccine prepared from V. cholerae conferred an increasing degree of protection of long duration, but, owing to severe vaccination reactions, its use could not be recommended.

Characteristics of non-cholera Vibrios isolated from cases of human diarrhoea.

Eighty-two organisms tentatively identified as non-cholera vibrios were isolated from cases of diarrhoea occurring in East Pakistan. In 19 well-studied cases they were the predominant organism recovered, and a rise in agglutinating-antibody titre was found in six of these cases.Because of this additional evidence that non-cholera vibrios cause diarrhoeal disease, it was necessary to evaluate simple screening tests as a means of recognizing them. It was found that all organisms that produced a gelatinase "zone", had typical vibrio morphology on microscopic examination, produced colonies showing a characteristic picture when examined by oblique light microscopy, and gave a positive "string" test were vibrios. Agglutination tests with vibrio O group I antiserum and with antirough vibrio serum distinguished the organisms from Vibrio cholerae. Since these organisms may be discarded by enteric diagnostic procedures directed mainly towards the isolation and identification of Salmonella and Shigella, it is recommended that the screening tests for these organisms be carried out in cases of diarrhoea of unknown etiology.

Studies on vaccination against bacillary dysentery. 1. Immunization of mice against experimental Shigella infection.

In the course of a series of experiments begun in 1954 a number of different killed vaccines prepared from Shigella flexneri 1 and 2a serotypes were tested for their immunogenicity after intraperitoneal administration in mice followed by challenge with virulent organisms of the same serotype; some live vaccines were also tested intraperitoneally or orally.Maintenance of the mice on Freter's regimen proved a reliable method of rendering them susceptible to intestinal infection with streptomycin-resistant shigellae.Two killed vaccines conferred good protection against intracerebral challenge, but neither live nor killed vaccines administered intraperitoneally protected against oral infection of mice maintained on Freter's regimen. However, oral administration of live vaccine did confer significant protection against homologous oral challenge, the degree of protection depending on the dose of vaccine.

Studies on vaccination against bacillary dysentery. 2. Safety tests and reactogenicity studies on a live dysentery vaccine intended for use in field trials.

In view of the encouraging results obtained in active mouse protection experiments, several batches of live oral vaccine prepared from streptomycin-dependent Shigella flexneri were tested in vitro for any indication of reversion to streptomycin-independence and in man for their reactogenicity.The in vitro tests provided no evidence of reversion.In man, major reactions were observed in only 1.4% of volunteers, all those so affected being heterotypic Shigella carriers in whom clinical exacerbation was induced. Both the intensity and the frequency of the minor reactions observed in other volunteers depended on the size of the vaccine dose administered. The dosage was also directly related to the duration of shedding of the vaccinal strain in the faeces and to the clinical exacerbation shown by heterotypic carriers.Both the phagocytic activity and the serum antibody titres were equally low before and after vaccination, but post-vaccination copro-antibody titres were 8-32 times higher with homologous than with heterologous antigens.

Studies on vaccination against bacillary dysentery. 3. Effective oral immunization against Shigella flexneri 2a in a field trial.

In May 1963 a live vaccine prepared from streptomycin-dependent Shigella flexneri 2a was administered to 355 soldiers stationed in an area of Yugoslavia in which bacillary dysentery was hyperendemic. Five oral doses were given every third day. 382 unvaccinated soldiers from the same unit served as controls. Both groups were closely followed up until 16 September.Examination of 1637 rectal swabs from the vaccinated and control groups indicated that vaccination did not affect the carrier rate. The morbidity from shigellae of serotypes not contained in the vaccine was the same in the two groups; but Sh. flexneri 2a caused dysentery in 5.5% of the control group but in none of the vaccinated soldiers-a statistically significant difference.A similar vaccine, given in a much lower dose, was also tried among soldiers of another unit; the dose was insufficient to confer protection.The authors conclude that the results of these field trials justify further studies with live Shigella vaccine.

Enteric virus isolation in different cell cultures.

The need for establishing an optimum tissue culture cell line for isolation of enteric viruses prompted a comparative study of cell lines for the isolation of enteric viruses from rectal swab specimens. The viruses isolated included all three types of poliovirus, 12 types of echovirus, seven types of group A and two of group B coxsackievirus, 24 strains of adenovirus, and eight untyped agents which probably represent new enteroviruses. One hundred positive isolations were made from 387 rectal swab specimens; 86 were obtained in human kidney cultures. This was almost twice the number obtained with monkey kidney and more than one-and-a-half times that obtained with human lung cells (WI-38). A diploid human epithelial cell line (Attleson) was tested and was found to be inferior to both monkey kidney and WI-38 cells for enteric viruses. Human kidney cells were particularly useful for group A coxsackieviruses and adenoviruses.

Some observations on the ecology of infectious hepatitis.

Analysis of reported rates for infectious hepatitis in the USA and in New York State for the years 1954 through 1962 reveals an inverse relationship between incidence and population density in epidemic as well as inter-epidemic periods. Patterns of age-specific rates were also found to vary with population density, the fluctuations being much greater in rural than in urban areas. The gradual change of hepatitis from a predominantly childhood to an adult disease is noted in data from California.The observations based on data from the USA are compared with those for Denmark and contrasted with recently reported studies from eastern Europe. Such comparisons may prove of value in predicting patterns to be anticipated in areas where infectious hepatitis is currently in the early or pre-epidemic stage of its evolution as a public health problem.

Immunization against neonatal tetanus in New Guinea. Antitoxin response of pregnant women to adjuvant and plain toxoids.

Immunization of pregnant women in New Guinea with three injections of plain toxoid had previously been shown to prevent neonatal tetanus. In the present study antitoxin levels induced by two oil-adjuvant toxoids (one injection), one AlPO(4) toxoid (two injections) and one plain toxoid (three injections) were compared with those induced by the same plain toxoid as used in the earlier study. At term there was no significant difference in the levels for the five toxoids, but those for the plain toxoids later declined rapidly. AlPO(4)-toxoid titres were significantly higher than the titres for the plain toxoids at the end of a year, but lower than the oil-adjuvant titres, which were the highest and most persistent. However, unacceptable side-effects (induced by subsequent lots of oil-adjuvant toxoids) preclude their routine use at present.The results indicate that a maternal antitoxin level at delivery of 0.01 unit/ml is protective. Aluminium-compound toxoid rapidly achieved titres that were better than this for at least a year, with minimal side-effects. Hence such toxoids are recommended for maternal immunization to prevent neonatal tetanus.

Research on ascariasis immunity and immunodiagnosis.

The pattern of antibody response to Ascaris in the blood of experimentally infected human beings, pigs and laboratory animals indicates that immunity to ascariasis develops mainly under the effect of migrating larvae. The antibody can be demonstrated in the microprecipitation test on live larvae in vitro and in the agglutination test with carmine-adsorbed antigen. The antibodies can be detected 5-10 days after infection and remain in the blood for 90-100 days.The pattern observed in the increase in antibody titre permits the use of serological reactions both for diagnosis of the early phase of ascariasis and for investigation of a number of problems in the epidemiology of this infection. Application of immunological methods in mass surveys of the population makes it possible to correct existing conceptions of the duration of the season of infection, the extent of infection and the risk of infection in foci of ascariasis.

Electrophoretic studies of some planorbid egg proteins.

Morphological characters alone have so far failed to provide adequate criteria for the identification of the molluscan intermediate hosts of African schistosomes. In the course of investigations into various other taxonomic approaches, it has been found that the egg proteins, when subjected to electrophoresis, are sensitive indicators of differences at the population level. About 80 populations of various species of African and Neotropical planorbids have been examined in this preliminary study. Differences at the population level have a considerable bearing on relationships between the snails and the larval schistosomes that parasitize them and help to explain the evolution of local races of schistosomes.

Molluscicidal properties and selective toxicity of surface-active agents.

Of over 100 commercially produced surface-active agents tested against the bilharziasis vector snail Biomphalaria sudanica, 13 were found to possess considerable and highly selective molluscicidal properties at concentrations of less than 1 ppm for exposures of 48 hours. Against crustacea, fish, water plants, mosquito larvae, mice, and the eggs of B. sudanica, the toxicities of the 13 surfactants were slight. The chemicals did not appear to be absorbed by organic matter to any appreciable extent. It is thought that the toxicity to B. sudanica is of both a chemical and a physical nature.

Drug dependence: its significance and characteristics.

It has become impossible in practice, and is scientifically unsound, to maintain a single definition for all forms of drug addiction and/or habituation. A feature common to these conditions as well as to drug abuse in general is dependence, psychic or physical or both, of the individual on a chemical agent. Therefore, better understanding should be attained by substitution of the term drug dependence of this or that type, according to the agent or class of agents involved, in discussions of these conditions, especially inter-disciplinary. Short descriptions, followed by concise listings of their characteristics, are formulated for the various types of dependence on at present widely abused major groups of substances.

Interocular transfer in goldfish: color easier than pattern.

Goldfish were trained to monocularly discriminate different patterns that also differed in color. When tested with reversed combinations of color and pattern cues, the fish responded on the basis of pattern while using the trained eye but on the basis of color while using the untrained eye. Interhemispheric transfer of color information was therefore more effective than that of pattern.

Major urinary protein complex of normal mice: origin.

Mouse serum contains protein having the same charge density and molecular size as the major urinary protein complex of mice. Mouse liver (but not eight other tissues examined) incorporated amino acids labeled with carbon-14 into the complex in vitro. The degree of incorporation was greater in livers from males than from females, and was internmediate in livers from females treated with testosterone.

Double mating: its use to study heritable factors in dental caries.

When Osborne-Mendel female rats (white) were mated with both an Osborne-Mendel and an NIH Black rat male during the same breeding period, litters were born which contained both Osborne-Mendel (white) and crossbred (grey to black) offspring. The Osborne-Mendel and crossbred animals developed widely different levels of caries activity even though they were exposed to identical environmental conditions during the intrauterine, preweaning, and experimental periods. These findings are indicative of a strong heritable influence on the development of dental caries.

Hemadsorption-negative plaque test: new assay for rubella virus revealing a unique interference.

A simple and rapid plaque procedure has been developed for detecting and accurately assaying rubella virus in a noncytopathic virus-cell relationship. Plaque-formation is based on the development, in individual cells infected with rubella virus, of a unique type of intrinsic interference to infection with Newcastle disease virus. Rubella virus-infected cells challenged with Newcastle disease virus and tested for hemadsorption 15 hours later stand out as hemadsorption-negative areas. Individual living cells infected with rubella virus can be resolved under conditions allowing standard cloning procedures. In principle, the hemadsorption-negative plaque test can be used to search for a new class of noncytopathic, non-hemadsorbing viruses-those that induce an intrinsic interference to infection by any hemadsorbing virus.

Hurler's syndrome: demonstration of an inherited disorder of connective tissue in cell culture.

Skin fibroblasts from three patients with Hurler's syndrome were grown in tissue culture and shown to contain metachromatic granules when stained for mucopolysaccharides with toluidine blue O. Similar inclusions were observed in cultures of fibroblasts from other members of the families, who appeared to be clinically normal but who were, judged from studies of pedigree, heterozygous or hemizygous for the abnormal gene.

Primary immune reactions in organ cultures.

Primary immune reactions were initiated and maintained in vitro. Spleen explants from mice treated with either phytohemagglutinin or adjuvant were stimulated to form hemagglutinins and hemolysins, whereas no treatment of spleen donors was necessary to invoke a "graft-versus-host" response which led to specific splenomegly.

Inhibition of L1210 tumor growth by thymus DNA.

Growth of L1210 leukemia cells which had been previously incubated with thymus DNA was inhibited. Leukemia-cell DNA did not affect tumor growth under similar conditions. Pretreatment of the thymus DNA with deoxyribonuclease suppressed the DNA induced inhibition. Both ribonucleasetreated DNA and untreated DNA inhibited tumor growth.

Focal antibody production by transferred spleen cells in irradiated mice.

Lethally irradiated mice were injected with small numbers of normal spleen cells and then immunized with sheep erythrocytes. Antibody activity was found in their spleens in localized areas whose number corresponded to the number of spleen cells injected. When sheep and pig erythrocytes were injected together, antibody against each was found in separate areas. Each area may consist of the progeny of a single precursor cell, restricted to forming a single antibody.

Asian influenza in 1963 in two general practices in Cambridge, England.

A clinical, epidemiological and virological investigation was conducted on patients in two general practices in Cambridge, England, during an influenza epidemic between February and April 1963. The epidemiological pattern differed from that of the 1957-58 Asian influenza epidemic in that the overall incidence was considerably lower (3.2%) and that the highest attack rates were not in school children but in pre-school children (71.5 per 1000 persons).Virological investigation confirmed the diagnosis of Influenza A2 infection in 56 of 63 patients (89%). Isolations were made in 29 of 51 specimens tested. Serological studies revealed that the complement fixation test was more reliable than hemagglutination - inhibition or neutralization tests. Clinical features resembled those reported in previous epidemics, cough, headache and limb pains being prominent features.

Heat stabilities of acid phosphatases from pinto bean leaves.

Two acid phosphatases were demonstrable by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. They had different mobilities and different heat stabilities in 1.0M acetate buffer, pH 5.2. Both phosphatases had the same electro-phoretic mobility in tris buffer at pH 7.5, gave one boundary in the analytical ultracentrifuge in tris or acetate buffer, and had the same sedimentation coefficient. The difference in these properties suggests an alteration in conformation of the proteins by the buffer systems.

Inhibitory oxidation products of indole-3-acetic acid: enzymic formation and detoxification by pea seedlings.

Extracts of etiolated pea seedlings oxidize indole-3-acetic acid, a plant auxin, to 3-hydroxymethyloxindole. At physiological pH this compound is dehydrated to 3-methyleneoxindole, a highly reactive sulfhydryl reagent and inhibitor of cell growth. 3-Methlyeneoxindole is in turn detoxified by an enzymatic, triphosphopyridine nucleotide-linked reduction to 3-methyloxindole, a nontoxic compound. These enzymatic conversions may be responsible for some of the responses to auxin, particularly sensitivity to its inhibitory effects on growth.

Actinomycin D and Hydrocortisone: intracellular binding in rat liver.

DNA was found to be the major intracellular binding site for labeled actinomycin D administered in vivo. In analogous studies, hydrocortisone did not bind to nuclear structures. Furthermore, following the administration of actinomycin D, a highly positive correlation was found between the RNA content of the nucleus and the ability of the nucleus to synthesize RNA.

Tetrodotoxin and manganese ion: effects on action potential of the frog heart.

Tetrodotoxin, which effectively suppresses the permeability of various tissues to sodium ions, has no effect on the calcium action potential of the fiber of barnacle muscle, which potential is produced by increase in permeability to calcium ions. Manganese ions, however, suppress the action potential. When applied to fiber of frog cardiac ventricle, tetrodotoxin suppresses the rate of rise of the action potential without affecting the overshoot; the suppressive effect of manganese ion is mainly on the overshoot of the action potential. This suggests that, in the action potential of the car-diac ventricle of the frog, the platealu phase is related primarily to the increase in permeability of the membrane to calcium ions.

Anesthesia of Artemia larvae: method for quantitative study.

Potency of anesthetics is quantitatively measured with laboratory-hatched larvae of the brine shrimp Artemia salina. Statistical fluctuations are minimized in that 100,000 animals are used to determine a single median anesthetic dose value. The technique was developed to study molecular mechanisms of general anesthesia.

Base specificity in the interaction of polynucleotides with antibiotic drugs.

Echinomycin, daunomycin, ethidium bromide, nogalamycin, chromomycin, mithramycin, and olivomycin inhibit RNA synthesis by RNA polymerase by interacting with the DNA template. Chromomycin and olivomycin form complexes with DNA, preferably in the helical form, but not with RNA. These complexes require guanine in DNA and the addition of a stoichiometric amount of bivalent cation. None of the other antibiotics requires the presence of any single base in the template for its action.

Chondroitin sulfate: inhibition of synthesis by puromycin.

Puromycin reversibly inhibits synthesis of chondroitin sulfate by vertebral chondrocytes from 10-day-old chick embryos. Treatment of these cells with puromycin for 5 hours does not affect viability or capacity to multiply on subsequent release from their matrix. It is suggested that synthesis of this polysaccharide is coupled with that of protein; there may be a feedback control in its synthesis.

Preservation of mammalian cells in a chemically defined medium and dimethylsulfoxide.

Three established mammalian cell lines (cat kidney, L, and HeLa cells), grown in suspension in a protein-free, chemically defined medium, were stored under liquid nitrogen in the defined medium fortified with 4 and 8 percent dimethylsulfoxide. After storage for 1 month the recovery viability was 86 percent, and cells showed normal growth upon reinoculation into the defined growth medium.

Tritium: distribution in Busycon canaliculatum (L.) injected with labeled reserpine.

Tritiated reserpine was injected into the body cavities of specimens of Busycon canaliculatum (Mollusca, Gastropoda). Only the ganglia, liver, and kidney were radioactive throughout the 14-day experiment. Radioactivity of the kidney and liver increased after the first measurement; that of the ganglia declined during the first day but later remained constant.

Alpha-hydroxy acid oxidase: localization in renal microbodies.

Differential and density equilibrium centrifugation have established the presence of alpha-hydroxy acid oxidase in microbodies of the kidney of the rat. The enzyme has been demonstrated in cells of the distal convoluted tubule by a microscopic cytochemical method. This enzyme, like certain others in microbodies, produces hydrogen peroxide.

Malignant lymphomas following allogenic disease: transition from an immunological to a neoplastic disorder.

The graft versus host reaction which occurs in F(1) hybrid mice injected with parental spleen cells was used to examine several immunological theories of neoplasia. Long-term survivors of this reaction developed lymphoid neoplasms which resembled Hodgkin's disease and lymphosarcoma. Mice with these tumors were chimeras, but the parental cells present within their spleens had specific immunological tolerance toward host antigens. This, together with the finding that the tumors were transplantable only to isogenic recipients, indicates that the tumors were of host rather than donor origin.

Triploidy in human cell line.

Cytogenetic studies of a human amnion cell line (strain RA) indicate that the major stem cell was triploid. Consistently present in the triploid cells were two marker chromosomes, a small centric fragment, and an apparently telocentric D. At various times triploid cells constituted 40 to 80 percent of the cell population. The possible origin of the triplaid cell is a diploid/ triploid mosaic amnion.

Inheritance of two alkaline phosphatase variants in fowl plasma.

Starch-gel electrophoresis of plasina reveals two mnutually exclusive forms of alkaline phosphatase. Analysis of the plasma of 931 birds from 96 sib families of two inbred lines through two generations shows that the faster-moving isozymne is determined by an autosomal gene Ap(2) which is completely dominant to its allele Ap(4) determining the slower form.

Operations on the colon. The role of antibiotics in preoperative preparation.

A study was carried out on 183 patients in an attempt to evaluate the role of antibiotics in the preoperative preparation of the colon.Kanamycin, neomycin and a placebo were administered in a double-blind fashion during a 72-hour period preceding operation. In addition, mechanical cleansing of the bowel was done in all cases. Considering only the criteria of mortality and the incidence of postoperative wound and peritoneal infections in this preliminary report there was no apparent significant difference between patients receiving antibiotics and those receiving a placebo.

Use of 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine (Idoxuridine) in cutaneous herpes simplex.

Twelve patients with cutaneous herpes simplex were treated in a double blind series with either 0.1 per cent idoxuridine solution or a placebo. There was no significant difference in healing time between those receiving the drug and those the placebo. The same conclusion was noted in a series of eleven patients using either 1 per cent idoxuridine in a cream or a placebo.

Psychological aspects of medical prescription.

Medication possesses a potential for therapeutic efficacy far beyond its chemical capacity if prescribed in ways which enlist patients' personality traits in a therapeutic direction. "Prescription" in this sense includes the physician's attitude (as the patient sees it) and subtleties in the way he fits his instructions to the kind of patient he is dealing with. This presentation deals with four kinds of patients-widely different in what they need from the physician-for whom some therapeutic "placebo" effect of prescription can be brought to bear:1. Patients who are unduly fearful about what is wrong with them, and who look to the physician for calm sureness.2. Systematic, controlled, organized patients, who like to share in their own medical management.3. Patients who are excessively depressed about being sick.4. Patients for whom "nothing works," but who can be helped by a physician who is willing to accept "failure" in dealing with them. For all of them, careful appraisal and sophisticated treatment are necessary.

Muscle paralysis in herpes zoster.

Herpes zoster may, in some instances, cause motor paralysis as well as the usual sensory and cutaneous manifestations. It is suggested that the presence of electromyographic denervation potentials be used as the criterion of muscle paresis in order to avoid mistaking atrophy of disuse for true lower motor neuron disease. Use of the proper physical therapy procedures hastens the recovery of function and may serve to retard denervation atrophy and fibrosis in patients with muscle paralysis.

Interfering substances of menopausal urine for red cells coated with human chorionic gonadotropic hormone.

Interfering substances of menopausal urine for red cells coated with human chorionic gonadotropic hormone (HCG) were studied.  OF 187 urine specimens from menopausal women, 19 (10.2%) showed the presence of a substance that interfered with the formation of the "doughnut" of red cells in the control tube of the urinary chorionic gonadotropic test for pregnancy. The interfering substance was not found consistently and could usually be removed with polydextran powder or by storage of the urine specimen at 5 degrees c or below. The degree of interference obtained with the same specimen depended upon the particular lot number of the reagent tested. It appears that the presence of the interfering substance in the urine of menopausal women may follow a hormonal pattern.

Some aspects of abdominal surgery in the elderly patient.

Most operations on elderly patients are of an urgent nature. If time permits, measures to improve cardiac, respiratory and renal functions in the appropriate ways should be undertaken. During recovery from anesthesia careful but adequate sedation will reduce the risk of myocardial ischemia. Throughout the postoperative period constant encouragement of the older patient is particularly helpful.Transverse abdominal incisions and the frequent use of temporary gastrostomy are advocated.External hernia, hiatus hernia, peptic ulcer, carcinoma of the stomach, biliary disease, appendicits, intestinal obstruction, and carcinoma of the large intestine are discussed specifically, with special reference to the practical details of management in the elderly patient.

Old age income security in Canada.

The position of older people in modern industrial society is markedly removed from the early industrial norm of continued participation in gainful employment until the end of life. Acceptance of a retirement age some 13 years before the end of average male life expectancy has brought with it serious social problems. At the same time, however, an increasingly productive economy has provided both the willingness and ability to complement the retirement provisions of individual initiative with public programs of old age income maintenance. This public support began in Canada with the voluntary approach embodied in the government annuities plan. A program of "public assistance" followed. These were succeeded, first, by the "universal payment" under the Old Age Security Act and, more recently, by the social insurance approach of the Canada Pension Plan. Along with improved public support, the role of occupational pension plans and of individually initiated retirement provisions continues to be substantial. Current interest in, and in some cases legislation on, such problems as vesting and solvency are leading to improvements in private pension programs.

Bronchiolar emphysema (diffuse bronchiolectasis)--so-called muscular cirrhosis of the lungs.

Eleven autopsied cases of bronchiolar emphysema are reported. In all, both lungs were involved. Their pleural surfaces were finely bosselated, presenting an appearance resembling that of the liver in Laennec's cirrhosis. The lungs were firm, they cut with increased fibrous resistance, and the cut surfaces were honeycombed with cysts.Microscopically, the cysts originated in terminal bronchioles. Their walls were thickened with fibrous tissue, elastic fibres and prominent smooth muscle. Areas of lung parenchyma were replaced by fibrous tissue rich in elastic fibres.The etiology of this disease is unknown. Inherent weakness of the myoelastic wall of the respiratory bronchiole, hypoplasia of the distal segment of the respiratory unit, and superimposed recurrent respiratory infections probably are essential in its pathogenesis. The pulmonary changes cause interference with hemorespiratory gaseous exchange.Death was due to respiratory failure in seven cases, to cardiac failure in three and to superimposed staphylococcal pneumonia in one.

Lincomycin in hospital practice.

The usefulness of the new antibiotic, lincomycin, was assessed on both bacteriological and clinical grounds. Of 3200 strains of staphylococci isolated from clinical material, only 40 were resistant to lincomycin. These 40 were all of the same phage type and in fact almost all represented different isolations of the same staphylococcus which had spread to cross-infect various patients. Sixteen of 22 patients with staphylococcal infections, nine of 14 with pneumonia, 15 of 17 with acute exacerbations of bronchitis and two patients with other bacterial infections recovered completely with lincomycin therapy. The only side effect was diarrhea in four of the 42 patients given the drug by mouth. The place of lincomycin in therapeutics seems to be principally in the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis and, in patients allergic to the penicillins, in the treatment of staphylococcal, respiratory and other infections for which penicillin is usually employed.

A psychiatric emergency service: a preliminary report.

An emergency service for psychiatric patients was organized in a general hospital owing to the increasing need for such a service. Its main functions have been to screen cases, to offer short-term treatment, and to provide immediate consultation facilities to general practitioners and clinical experience to students, interns and residents.Of 133 patients, 40% were diagnosed as psychotic and 35% as neurotic. The commonest presenting symptoms were anxiety and depression. Approximately 40% were treated by the staff of the emergency service, 40% were sent back to the general practitioner for treatment, and 20% were transferred to a mental hospital.It is concluded that this type of service can provide immediate and effective consultation and treatment for psychiatric emergencies, and is a very useful teaching facility, especially for students and physicians not intending to specialize in psychiatry.

Normal variation of talar tilt of the ankle in children.

Sixty normal children were examined clinically and radiologically, using a special apparatus with a goniometer and a tensometer to standardize stress tests when applying valgus and varus forces to the ankle. It was noted that the clinical movement of inversion is not entirely due to a subtalar movement; indeed a talar tilt appears to be physiological. The range of normal in these patients, age range 6 to 15 years, was 0 to 27 degrees with an average talar tilt of 7 degrees . The talar tilt is not necessarily the same in both ankles of any one individual and it is never noted in eversion. The talar tilt is more marked in younger children in the position of equinus.When interpreting radiographs of recently injured ankles, it is wise to recall that a talar tilt need not be the result of trauma and that it may be physiological and yet unequal on both sides.

Coca leaf and cocaine addiction--some historical notes.

Coca-leaf habituation has affected millions of Andean natives for over 400 years. In the last half-century it has also involved millions more Malayans. Coca leaf, from which cocaine and extracts for some commercial carbonated soft drinks are obtained, remains relatively unknown by the medical and allied professions elsewhere. A review of the original medical, historical and other pertinent literature of the last 350 years illustrates the origins of the use of coca leaf, its spread, the isolation of cocaine and its first uses, as well as some of the euphoric and other effects of both substances.

The diagnosis of early carcinoma of the prostate.

Careful palpation of the gland is a very important examination procedure in the detection of early carcinoma in the prostate. The finding of a suspicious area requires additional investigation, which must include histological examination of tissue from the suspected lesion. Adequate material for histological studies can usually be obtained by needle biopsy. The percutaneous perineal approach has been found satisfactory for this purpose. In those whose life expectancy is 10 years or more, prostatic carcinoma in its early stages should be treated by radical prostatectomy. For more advanced lesions or for patients whose life expectancy is less, hormonal therapy may be used.

Implantation of the right and left internal mammary arteries with epicardiectomy and free omental graft: a preliminary experimental report.

In animal experiments the right internal mammary artery was implanted into the outflow tract of the right ventricle during performance of left mammary artery implantation with epicardiectomy and free omental graft. The effect of double mammary artery implantation operation was tested by triple coronary artery ameroid constriction in 24 animals. In 20 animals studied both implanted arteries remained open and had commenced to bud and branch at the time of examination. The double implant operation is still an experimental procedure.

Response of the pupil to steady-state retinal illumination: contribution by cones.

Response of the pupil to steady-state retinal illumination was measured in an observer who lacked functioning rods. At high intensities, this response was as great as that of a normal eye. These results cannot be explained by the hypothesis that only rods are receptors for the steady-state response.

Observations on the toxicity of carbaryl, folithion and 3-isopropylphenyl n-methylcarbamate in a village-scale trial in Southern Nigeria.

Two carbamates and one organophosphorus insecticide were evaluated in a village-scale trial in Nigeria by the WHO Insecticide Testing Unit. Toxicological studies on exposed spraymen and villagers included clinical observations, determination of plasma cholinesterase activity and-in the case of the carbamates-determination of metabolites in urine. While a village-scale trial can provide a basis for evaluation of the risk to which villagers are exposed, the risk to the spraymen cannot be fully assessed since the spraying operation in a single village lasts a comparatively short time. The toxicological information gained in this trial has shown that one of the carbamates tested (3-isopropylphenyl N-methylcarbamate) is too toxic to man to be used as a residual insecticide in houses. The other two insecticides (carbaryl and Folithion) have proved safe enough to warrant their being subjected to an extended field trial, provided that precautionary measures similar to those described in the paper are undertaken.

Toxicities of certain larvicides to resistant and susceptible Aedes aegypti (L.).

In a study of the toxicological characteristics of dieldrin-resistant and DDT-resistant strains of Aedes aegypti, combined with an evaluation of certain larvicides, 14 cyclodienes, 13 DDT-type compounds, 18 organophosphorus compounds, several carbamates and a number of other compounds were tested against larvae of A. aegypti. Telodrin and GC-9160 proved to be toxic against a highly dieldrin-resistant strain. Against highly DDT-resistant strains the toxicity of DDT could be enhanced by piperonyl butoxide, DMC or WARF, that of deutero-DDT by DMC, and that of methoxychlor by piperonyl butoxide. Prolan and Bulan were found to be slightly less effective than deutero-DDT against highly DDT-resistant strains. Among the more recent organophosphorus compounds found to exceed fenthion in toxicity are AC-52160, Stauffer N-2404, Folithion, Bayer 52957 and SD-7438. The effectiveness of dimethrin could be enhanced with piperonyl butoxide.

The inheritance of yellow-larva and ruby-eye in Culex pipiens.

It has been suggested that mosquito vectors of filariasis and other diseases might be controlled by genetic methods. This is not yet possible because of the lack of genetic information concerning the vector species. The present study describes the development of a marker strain which is being used to study genetic control.Two spontaneous mutants of Culex pipiens are described, one for the first time. Ruby-eye (ru) is an autosomal recessive in linkage group 2. It is completely penetrant and completely expressed. It is evident in later instar larvae, pupae, and adults. Yellow-larva (y) is an autosomal recessive, sometimes behaving as a partial dominant, and is also in linkage group 2. It is evident in late fourth-instar larvae and pupae and is generally associated with lengthened larval development. Ruby-eye and yellow-larva are occasionally seen in collections from the field. The frequency of crossing over between ru and y differs significantly among progenies and also between the sexes, the median values being 17% in males and 24% in females.

Control of a type 1 poliomyelitis epidemic in British Guiana, 1962-63, with trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine. 2. Virological aspects.

Epidemics of paralytic poliomyelitis have been reported with increasing frequency in the Caribbean area over the last decade. During the first weeks of a type 1 poliomyelitis epidemic in British Guiana in the winter of 1962-63, it was possible to study "wild" poliovirus infections in pre-school children, and to obtain information concerning the effectiveness of a country-wide control programme using trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine.Serological studies indicated that many Guianese children had had previous asymptomatic poliovirus infections by school age. However, there were more children with antibodies to types 2 and 3 than with antibodies to type 1. Following the first of two feedings of trivalent vaccine, there were significant increases in the percentage of children with poliovirus antibodies.Though begun only three weeks after the hospitalization of several paralysed children, a rectal-swab survey indicated that in some areas over one-third of the pre-school children were excreting "wild" poliovirus. In one area of the country, where only 2% of the children were excreting poliovirus type 1, vaccine feeding seemed most effective in containing the epidemic. These results support the suggestion that to be successful an epidemic control programme in a developing tropical country should be rapidly organized and completed.

Control of a type 1 poliomyelitis epidemic in British Guiana, 1962-63, with trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine. 1. Epidemiological aspects.

An epidemic of poliomyelitis took place in British Guiana during the winter of 1962-63. A total of 485 paralytic cases occurred over a 10-week period, 90% in children under 5 years of age.The attack rate for the total population of more than half-a-million persons was 86.5 per 100 000. Type 1 poliovirus was isolated from stool specimens from 90% of the paralytic cases studied. Early in the epidemic, before virus was isolated, plans were developed for an extensive field study to characterize the epidemic and evaluate the effectiveness of trivalent vaccine as a practical control measure.Vaccine was administered to 85% of the children aged 5 or less over a 4-week period. A definite beneficial effect was noted; however, the epidemic might have been more impressively terminated had the programme been more rapidly administered. The importance of early recognition of an outbreak of poliomyelitis and of the rapid planning and execution of a vaccination programme is stressed.

A somatic antigen vaccine for the prevention of meningococcal cerebrospinal meningitis.

Meningococcal cerebrospinal meningitis is an important public health problem in certain parts of the world-notably in Africa between the Sahara and the equator-and efforts are being made to control the disease by active immunization. To this end, the Laboratory of Hygiene of the Department of National Health and Welfare of Canada has undertaken studies on the development of lysed, clear (somatic antigen) vaccines, the method of preparation of which is described in this paper.Three Group A strains of Neisseria meningitidis have been used, two of them isolated from cases in the area of Africa for which the vaccines are intended. The vaccines have successfully passed stringent safety tests, and preliminary limited studies in the epidemic area have indicated that they are relatively reaction-free in man. They have been found effective in protecting mice against challenge with a wide range of Group A strains of N. meningitidis as well as with some Group B, C and D strains, but the authors stress that the value of these vaccines for man will remain uncertain until satisfactory field trials can be carried out.

Chelometric determination of aluminium in vaccines.

A rapid and accurate chelometric method is described for the determination of aluminium in aluminium-phosphate-adsorbed vaccines. Thiomersal preservative in the vaccine is first destroyed and the aluminium content is determined by addition of excess disodium edetate (Na(2)-EDTA) and back-titration with zinc sulfate using dithizone as an indicator. Phosphate does not interfere with the method. The aluminium content of the samples under investigation varied from 0.3 mg/ml to 1.0 mg/ml. In analysis of vaccines containing inactivated poliomyelitis virus, aluminium was determined with a standard deviation of 0.0014 mg and in other vaccines with a standard deviation of approximately 0.0040 mg.

The species of the genus Bulinus, intermediate hosts of Schistosoma.

The conditions of snail life in African inland waters favour the evolution of microgeographical races while hindering the formation of new species, and the distinctions between many of the bulinid intermediate hosts of Schistosoma are consequently blurred. In this paper the author comments on the distinguishing characters that have been established for the known Bulinus species and subspecies and summarizes the present knowledge of their distribution and importance as intermediate hosts. His work is based on the examination of over 1540 snail samples received at the WHO Snail Identification Centre in Charlottenlund, Denmark.

On the mathematical analysis of schistosome populations.

The concept of the stationary ecological life-table has been applied to populations of the three main species of schistosomes affecting man. In such a system, the net reproductive rate should be equal to 1.0, with reproduction and mortality balancing each other. Calculations are made of net reproduction in both snail and mammal hosts and of the probabilities of transmission from each host to the other. By far the most complete data are those for Schistosoma japonicum, for which the net reproductive rate is calculated as 0.588. The error probably represents the inadequacy of information on rat populations. Using much less complete data, the net reproductive rate for S. mansoni is calculated as 1.85 and for S. haematobium as 2.74. The relative departure from the expected value of 1.0 thus reflects the lack of complete information on the respective parasites. Details of the method and examples of each kind of calculation are given.It is estimated that with adequate data from three or four areas with a range of transmission rates, a predictive model could be constructed for the epidemiology of one species of parasite, and that adequate staff could obtain the necessary data in two-and-a-half years.

The ecology of schistosome transmission foci.

The study of cercarial populations in the field can provide a useful means of locating schistosome transmission foci and of evaluating the success of bilharziasis control programmes. It also provides a means of learning about certain aspects of transmission that have hitherto been neglected.In recent years six techniques have been successfully field-tested or employed in field research on the biology of the cercarial stage of schistosomes. They include several variations of paper filtration of the water, the use of phototaxy for separating cercariae from water, and bioassay by exposing mice to infective water. The various advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed in this paper. The author suggests that an approach to the ideal cercariometric method may be achieved by combining a paper filtration technique with mouse exposure.

Congenital chromosomal syndromes. A model for pathogenesis.

The origin of anomalies in the chromosomal syndromes is believed to be both polyetiologic and polypathogenetic. Whereas some malformations quite clearly appear to result from single gene mutations or from genic imbalance due to individual monosomic or trisomic loci, other anomalies (singly or in complex patterns) are better interpreted as originating from disturbances in particular biochemical pathways which affect the development of a variety of traits. Additional phenogenetic studies and the use of sophisticated biochemical analysis in persons with complex patterns of anomalies should provide a truer understanding of disease mechanisms and provide guidance for future studies which are aimed at the treatment and prevention of these intriguing misadventures of Nature.

This ring opens during acylation of the bacterial wall-building enzymes, but previous opening of the ring by acid or beta-lactamases destroys antibiotic activity.Semisynthetic substitutions may protect the ring by steric hindrance; this may actually inactivate certain penicillinases, so that resistant penicillins may potentiate penicillin G in some circumstances. However, the protective substitutions reduce the intrinsic activity of the synthetic penicillins themselves. Other properties which are affected include absorption, protein-binding, excretion, and possible allergenicity of the drugs. Effects on antibacterial spectrum may possibly be secondary to alteration of lipid solubility.

Combined antibiotic therapy.

THE INDICATIONS FOR COMBINED ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY ARE REVIEWED, AND TWO MAJOR INDICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED AT LENGTH: the prevention of development of antibiotic resistance and the possibility of achieving antibiotic synergism.Since micro-organisms vary in their behaviour in the presence of different antibiotic combinations, careful evaluation of clinical response and close laboratory control are necessary.Antibiotics are divided into four groups and their possible combinations are described. It is emphasized that bactericidal antibiotics, e.g. penicillin and streptomycin, which act only on multiplying bacteria, may be antagonized by some bacteriostatic antibiotics, e.g. tetracycline. Clinical observations appear to confirm the usefulness of this division of the antibiotics.

Antibiotic therapy of staphylococcal infections.

The antibiotic treatment of staphylococcal infections remains a problem. Isolation of the organism and sensitivity testing are necessary in the choice of antibiotic. Penicillin G is the most effective penicillin against non-penicillinase-producing staphy-lococci; for the penicillinase producers there is very little to choose between the semisynthetic penicillins, methicillin, cloxacillin, nafcillin and oxacillin. For patients who are hypersensitive to penicillin, the bacteriostatic drugs (erythromycin, novobiocin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, oleandomycin) are useful for mild infections, while for more severe illness the bactericidal drugs (vancomycin, ristocetin, kanamycin, bacitracin, neomycin) have been used successfully. Acute staphylococcal enterocolitis is probably best treated by a semisynthetic penicillin. Other antibiotics which have been found useful, with clinical trials, for staphylococcal infections are cephalosporin, fucidin, cephaloridine and lincomycin. The latter drug has been reported of value in the treatment of osteomyelitis. There is little justification for the prophylactic use of antibiotics to prevent staphylococcal infection. Surgical drainage is still an important adjunct in the treatment of many staphylococcal infections.

Antibiotic therapy in current surgical practice.

The clinical surgeon is required to assume important responsibilities in the management of microbial infections. To be effective, antibiotics should be used against sensitive organisms, the lesion should be infused adequately, and, ideally, the antibiotic should be bactericidal and compatible with other antibiotic agents in combination. A survey of commonly used antibiotics disclosed that penicillin in its synthetic and natural forms is still the drug of choice in most cases, particularly since, in its different forms, it may be used in combination with other agents to give a wide antibacterial spectrum. As a major surgical problem, Gram-positive septicemia has been superseded by Gram-negative septicemia and attendant endotoxin shock. Most authorities advocate a combination of bactericidal and bacteriostatic antibiotics in the treatment of endotoxin shock. However, while antibiotic therapy is considered crucial in the treatment of this condition, the mortality rate is still high and no uniform regimen of antibiotic therapy has been accepted.

The antibiotic treatment of urinary tract infection.

THE REASONS FOR THE RECURRENCE OF URINARY TRACT INFECTION AFTER ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY ARE: (1) underlying renal disease, (2) the short female urethra, and (3) bacterial resistance. Quantitative bacteriuria rather than pyuria is important in diagnosis. Radiologic changes are late manifestations of pyelonephritis. Treatment of lower urinary tract infection requires a high urinary drug level, whereas renal infection requires high tissue levels. Urinary pH adjustment increases antibiotic effectiveness. Therapy for recurrent infection should be continued for at least six months.

Local and systemic antibiotic therapy of wounds and burns.

Postoperative wound infection rates range between 3% for clean wounds to 28% for dirty wounds. Indiscriminate antibiotic prophylaxis is ineffective. Requisites for effectiveness are specificity of the antibiotic for wound pathogens, the achievement of therapeutic tissue levels within four to six hours of wounding, and use only for high-risk situations. Topical neomycin is recommended in special-risk clean cases. In addition, in contaminated cases, a combination of penicillin G, a biosynthetic penicillin, and broad-spectrum penicillin parenterally is used, preoperatively, intra-operatively, and immediately postoperatively. Intravenous penicillin G and a biosynthetic penicillin are used for patients with major trauma and burns.

<doc>
Adverse reactions to antimicrobial therapy.

Adverse reactions to antimicrobial agents consist of toxic effects mediated through chemical changes in tissue cells, sensitivity reactions produced by antigen-antibody reactions, and biological effects caused by alteration of the bacterial flora in the body. Patients vary in their susceptibility to these because of genetically determined differences in enzyme and protein make-up, differences in immunologic reactivity, differences in environment, or because of the effects of disease. Some antibiotics are capable of producing almost invariable damage to certain tissues if given long enough in sufficient dosage, whereas others produce disturbances in only occasional patients. Almost any organ in the body may be involved, indicating that the metabolic processes affected by these agents are represented to a varying degree in the cells of the host. Little is known of the specific mechanisms involved, but as information is acquired, it should be possible to reduce the incidence of reactions.

Syringomyelia: a clinical review of 75 cases.

Records of 75 patients with syringomyelia are reviewed. Their clinical course fell into one of three main groups: (1) those with a long history of a steadily progressive disability; (2) those with a long history but little or no progression of their disability; and (3) those with a short, fairly rapid downhill course.On the basis of this study, x-ray therapy seems to be of little value in the treatment of this disease. Surgical treatment on the other hand appears to offer more hope for a selected group of patients who are progressing at the time of examination. In this group surgery is recommended (1) in the presence of a foramen magnum anomaly with signs and symptoms related to this deformity; (2) in the presence of a distended cord with pain and evidence of a spinal fluid block; and (3) when the possibility of an ependymoma exists.

Clinical experience with vincaleukoblastine sulfate in the treatment of 11 patients with Hodgkin's disease.

Eleven patients with established Hodgkin's disease were treated with vinblastine sulfate. Each patient received from 0.15 to 0.20 mg./kg. of body weight intravenously in 10 divided doses over a five-hour period as initial therapy. All had received one or more of the more established forms of treatment before being given vinblastine. The response to treatment with vinblastine was excellent in three patients, good in one, and poor in three; there was no response in four. The longest remission was 15 months. Two of the patients were father and son. The side effects of treatment in this series included alopecia, leukopenia, and septicemia.

Coxsackie A10 virus infection among infectious hepatitis contacts.

During an outbreak of infectious hepatitis at a housing development, Coxsackie A10 virus was recovered from the stools of 45 different contacts and from the blood of four others. Caution should be exercised in attributing an etiological role to any given isolate of a Group A Coxsackie virus in view of the widespread distribution of these organisms. Nevertheless, the recovery of Coxsackie A10 viruses from the blood and stools of contacts with hepatitis cases appears to warrant record.

Preventive psychiatry: the psychiatric team as consultant to the public health nurse.

Various forms of collaboration between the disciplines of public health and psychiatry are briefly reviewed and the 25-year-old mental health program of the Vancouver Health Department is described. The public health nurse has prime responsibility in all children with emotional disorders. She is supported by a psychiatric team which provides active treatment and educational and consultative help for the nurse and the school. During the year 1963, six social workers had 2357 contacts with nurses and school personnel but only 1049 treatment interviews. Of 401 children referred to the psychiatric team, 138 received active clinic treatment, 141 remained under supervision by the public health nurse, and 122 were referred elsewhere. In addition, 1330 children were identified as "mental hygiene cases" in the caseload of the 170 public health nurses in the community. By close co-ordination, the public health nurse and the psychiatric team can enhance each other's contributions to community mental health.

The evaluation and choice of laboratory equipment and reagents.

Many new types of laboratory equipment are appearing on the market, as well as a large number of reagent sets or kits. The importance of adequate evaluation of the reliability of such new products cannot be overemphasized.Commercially prepared reagent sets or kits fall into two categories. In the one, a set of reagents is offered for use in performance of a particular conventional procedure; this type of prepared reagent should present no problem, provided that the reagents are stable. In the other category, a reagent kit or set is offered which has been designed to simplify the performance of a laboratory analysis, often by combining reagents and reducing the number of steps and the time required. Such a kit should be evaluated carefully in order to determine its efficiency and limitations. In general it is difficult to simplify greatly a laboratory procedure without sacrificing its accuracy.

Overnutrition in prenatal and neonatal life: a problem?

In most areas of the world nutritional problems are related to quantitative and qualitative deficiencies. However, in North America the possible harmful effects of overnutrition deserve careful consideration.Little information is available concerning overnutrition during prenatal and neonatal life. The author draws attention to this possibility by outlining clinical and biochemical disorders occurring in the newborn which are related to excessive ingestion of calories, fat, protein, vitamins and minerals before and after birth. Particular reference is made to the ingestion of nutritional substances during pregnancy in amounts that are relatively innocuous to the mother but may be harmful to the infant in utero.Further research in this interesting field is needed in an attempt to assess the effect on the fetus of qualitative overnutrition during pregnancy.

Body composition and body weight: criteria of overnutrition.

The terms "body weight" and "body composition" are by no means synonymous, and attention is increasingly being focused on body composition. A measurement of relative fatness is a better criterion of caloric overnutrition than is body weight.The simple technique of skinfold measurement using established standard methods is the most practical for use in the field to obtain an estimate of fatness or caloric overnutrition. The current need is for the establishment of "norms" for skinfolds for population groups of all ages and both sexes. When these are established, excellent simple criteria for overnutrition will be available.Prior to the establishment of norms, more work is needed to indicate which skinfolds for each age group and for each sex best reflect total body fatness. Body fatness may then be studied in relation to body weight and both may be related to morbidity, mortality and longevity. Finally, the answer may be obtained to the question whether it is overweight per se or overfatness that is related to excess morbidity and mortality.

Nutrition, onset of disease, and longevity in the rat.

The effect of food restriction in rats to a level 46% below the intake of those fed ad libitum was studied in relation to onset of disease and longevity. Dietary restriction at this level kept adult rats in a nutritional state short of the development of excess body fat, and had little effect on skeletal growth or sexual maturity. Onset of microscopically observed renal, vascular, myocardial and skeletal muscle lesions, as well as mammary fibroadenoma in females, was delayed and resulted in greater longevity. Life expectancy of male rats was increased by 25% and of females by 39%. Time of onset of disease appears to be regulated by a common factor which is influenced by dietary intake.

The applicability of North American growth standards in developing countries.

For the purpose of developmental evaluation of growing children and the nutritional assessment of individuals or populations, reliance on current North American standards for size, maturational timing, body fatness or osseous development may be unwise not only with respect to various African, Asiatic and Pacific populations but often with respect to adults and children in North America. In particular, the dental development and early ossification progress of most human groups are in advance of contemporary North American standards. The use of stature as a reference standard and the simple ratio of weight to height are both unsatisfactory measures except within clearly defined population samples. At the very least, age-size tables based on parental statures would be more realistic and useful for children of known parentage, whereas present-day averages that neglect parental size are most applicable to foundlings and illegitimate children.

Electron microscopy of the cell: cell structure and function.

The use of the electron microscope has added much to our knowledge of the cell. The fine structure of the component parts of the nucleus and the cytoplasm is described, and their functions are indicated. The nature and structural modifications of the plasma membrane are illustrated with particular reference to function. To illustrate the interrelationships of the nucleus and cytoplasm, the theory of protein secretion is discussed, the secretion of a particular protein or polypeptide being determined by a particular nucleotide sequence in the desoxyribonucleic acid of a chromosome, that is, by a gene. This information is transferred from nucleus to cytoplasm. It is in the cytoplasm that the majority of the work is performed while the nucleus directs the work of the cell.

Biological activities of pure prostaglandins.

Prostaglandins, the hydroxy unsaturated C20 fatty acids, are found throughout the body and have an equally wide range of biological activities.  Prostaglandins are known to: 1) stimulate uterine contraction; 2) inhibit spontaneous contraction of the rabbit uterus; 3) inhibit the respiratory smooth muscle of different animals; 4) lower systemic arterial blood pressure when injected intravenously; 5) stimulate contractions in isolateral segments of intestinal smooth muscle of most species investigated; 6) produce transient sedation when intravenously injected in cats, and 7) inhibit lipolysis induced by catechal amines, corticotrophin, glucagon and thyroid stimulating hormone.  The inhibitory and excitatory effects of prostaglandins may each have a physiological importance at different sites.  Current state of knowledge of the distribution, metabolism and actions of the prostaglandins is still fragmentary.  The functional significance of the prostaglandins is yet to be determined.

Comparative trial of live measles vaccines in Czechoslovakia.

The study reported in this article was conducted under the auspices of WHO as part of the Organization's programme on measles vaccination.In the spring of 1964, 416 children aged between 8 months and 3 years were inoculated with one or another of the following agents: Enders Edmonston B vaccine (alone or with gamma-globulin), Schwarz vaccine, Beckenham 20 vaccine, Milovanović vaccine, and a placebo.Seroconversion rates ranged from 91% to 100%, which indicates that the vaccines tested were highly immunogenic. The incidence of reactions was low, and from the clinical point of view acceptable. Clinical comparison of the reactions provoked by the different vaccines showed that the lowest rate was in the groups given Schwarz vaccine and Enders Edmonston B plus gamma-globulin, and the highest in the group given Beckenham 20 vaccine. However, the greater frequency of reactions observed with Beckenham 20 vaccine might have been due to the high dose given in the first stage of the trial.Complications were observed in 10 children, of whom four were in the placebo group. In three of the remaining cases a causal connexion with the vaccine could not be excluded with certainty.

Studies on attenuated measles-virus vaccines in Canada.

This paper describes the results of a study of live attenuated measles vaccines (one in a series of WHO-sponsored field trials) carried out in children 6-33 months old at an orphanage in Quebec City. The Enders Edmonston B vaccine alone and the same vaccine administered with gamma-globulin were compared with the Schwarz further-attenuated vaccine. The over-all seroconversion rates were found to be 96.9%, 98.1% and 98.8% respectively. Severe clinical reactions, except for high fever, were not observed in any of the groups. Rectal temperatures over 103 degrees F (39.5 degrees C) were noted in 16.2% of the children given Schwarz vaccine, in 59.2% of the children receiving the Enders Edmonston B vaccine alone and in 27.8% of the children inoculated with the Enders Edmonston B vaccine plus gamma-globulin. The high incidence of mild pharyngitis following inoculation of these vaccines was not observed in the group of children who had received vaccine plus gamma-globulin. No significant differences were noted in the frequency of other symptoms, such as cough, coryza, conjunctivitis and diarrhoea, between vaccinated and control groups.

A further study on measles vaccination in Nigerian children.

Measles is a serious disease in Nigeria, causing severe morbidity and appreciable mortality; it occurs almost exclusively in the pre-school child with a peak incidence in the second year of life. A safe measles vaccine would be of inestimable value both in that country and in other areas where the disease constitutes a grave menace. Studies using vaccines of the Enders Edmonston B type have shown that while these are efficient immunizing agents, severe reactions are too frequent to permit of their wide general use. In the quest for safer vaccines, and in accordance with the recommendations of a WHO Scientific Group, a field trial was undertaken in Western Nigeria in May 1964 to make direct comparisons of the antigenicity and reaction rates of three further-attenuated measles vaccines (Schwarz, Beckenham 20 and Beckenham 20/2) and Enders Edmonston B vaccine plus gamma-globulin. A control group was also included.Analysis of the clinical responses demonstrated that reactions were similar, and of minimal severity, in all vaccine groups. Neutralizing antibody responses showed that all the vaccines used were effective immunizing agents. From the point of view of ease of administration and expense, however, further-attenuated vaccines seem preferable to Enders Edmonston B administered with gamma-globulin.

Protective antigens from El Tor vibrios. 1. The preparation and properties of a purified protective antigen from an El Tor vibrio (Ogawa subtype).

A biochemically and immunologically homogeneous antigenic fraction having the properties of a lipopolysaccharide has been isolated from the culture supernatant of an El Tor vibrio (Ogawa subtype). This antigen was very specifically protective for mice challenged with Ogawa strains of either El Tor vibrios or Vibrio cholerae. Rabbit antisera prepared against the antigen were passively protective for mice and highly vibriocidal but had little agglutinating activity. However, the antigen was able specifically to absorb agglutinins, as well as mouse-protective and vibriocidal antibody from serum prepared against whole bacterial cells. The specific protective activity of this lipopolysaccharide was much greater than that of vaccines made from whole bacterial cells, and its toxicity in animals was about equivalent to that of whole cells. The relationship of activity to toxicity therefore represented an improvement over the vaccines that were studied.

Protective antigens from El Tor vibrios.  2. Responses in animals and man to a partially purified Ogawa lipopolysaccharide antigen.

A previous report described the extraction and purification of a mouse-protective lipopolysaccharide antigen from culture supernatants of an El Tor vibrio of the Ogawa subtype. The chemical procedures for complete purification were complex, and considerable antigen was lost. The present paper describes a simpler method of obtaining an antigen of only slightly less purity in considerably improved yield. The method appears to be feasible for the preparation of an antigen that might be suitable for extensive immunization studies in humans.The antigen has been compared with the purified lipopolysaccharide and the Ogawa reference vaccine supplied by the National Institutes of Health with respect to active protection in mice, toxicity in mice and rabbits, and ability to produce passive mouse-protective antibody and vibriocidal antibody in rabbits. It has also been administered to a small number of volunteers in whom it was studied for its reaction-producing properties and its ability to produce agglutinin, vibriocidin and passive mouse-protective antibody. Little toxicity was found at dosages that induced very significant antibody production, and antibody remained elevated for at least six months.

Respiratory virus antibodies in human sera from different regions of the world.

Over the past few years, many viruses have been isolated, particularly in the USA and Great Britain, from persons with respiratory disease. It is difficult to obtain suitable specimens from diverse areas of the world and test for viruses, but it is possible to obtain sera and test for antibodies. The present article reports the findings of an antibody survey of sera collected from 15 countries. The purpose of this survey was, first, to determine whether persons in these countries possessed antibodies against the "newer" respiratory viruses and therefore had been infected with these or related viruses, and, secondly, to look for quantitative differences in antibodies present in sera from different countries. A worldwide geographical distribution of antibodies was demonstrated which indicated a widespread distribution of those viruses considered in this study. Although it is widely believed that respiratory infections are less common and troublesome in hot or tropical regions, there was no evidence that sera obtained from countries with such climates contained less antibody than sera from countries with more temperate climates.

Antibodies to respiratory syncytial virus in human sera from different regions of the world.

Since it was first isolated in 1956, respiratory syncytial (RS) virus has been found in many parts of the world, generally in association with human respiratory illness, especially of young children. Previous studies have examined the frequency of serological evidence of infection in certain countries. The present study is a more general survey, dealing with the prevalence of RS virus antibody in sera from 14 different countries widely separated geographically. There was evidence of infection in all the populations studied, and the presence of antibody could not be accounted for by a relationship between RS virus and measles virus. It would therefore seem probable that RS virus is an agent of world-wide importance.

The antigenic structure of eight strains of influenza A viruses of avian origin was investigated by haemagglutination inhibition, virus neutralization and strain-specific complement fixation. All strains could be distinguished from each other, but certain cross-reactions were observed allowing the establishment of four antigenic groupings, as follows: (1) classic fowl plague virus ("Dutch" strain), Turkey/England/63 ("Langham" strain) and virus N; (2) two strains isolated from ducks, one in Czechoslovakia in 1956 and one in England in 1962; (3) a third strain isolated from ducks in England in 1956; (4) the "Smith" strain (Chicken/Scotland/59) and the tern virus (Tern/South Africa/61).This article also reports the results of tests to determine the capacity of the above-mentioned viruses to infect monkey-kidney cultures and to produce plaques in chick-embryo fibroblasts. It concludes with a discussion of problems connected with the classification and nomenclature of these viruses.

Long-acting and therapeutic properties of some Soviet and other penicillin preparations in experimental conditions.

The authors describe the results of studies carried out in rabbits infected with syphilis on the therapeutic properties and duration of penicillinaemia of a number of penicillin preparations manufactured in the USSR and of certain others from Czechoslovakia and the USA. These products were studied after intramuscular administration, mainly in doses of 42 000, 84 000 or 168 000 units per kg of body-weight.With all the preparations tested, the first of these doses proved inadequate. Almost, all however, gave satisfactory short-term and long-term results at 84 000 or 168 000 units, but the optimum manner of administration (number of injections and interval between injections) varied according to the preparation. One Soviet and one American preparation showed a considerably lower degree of long-term therapeutic activity and penicillinaemia, although providing a satisfactorily high level of penicillin in the blood for the first few hours after administration.The authors also discuss the reasons for the painfulness of injections of long-acting penicillin and the causes of complications such as embolism following administration.

Hormone excretion patterns during and ater the long-term administration of oral contraceptives.

Hormone assay studies were conducted in 5 29-42 year old women receiving long-term oral contraceptive therapy with progestogen-estrogen mixtures and in 1 38-year-old subject receiving a progestogen along.  The assays were made on 24-, 48-, or 72-hour pools of urine, and the results were expressed per 24-hour sample.  Urinary estriol, estrone, estradiol, and prenganediol were determined.  Urinary human pituitary gonadotropin (HPS) was determined, and the results were expressed in human menopausal gonadotropin units per 24 hours.  In 5 subjects, assays of estrogens, preganediol, and HPG were performed; in the sixth subject, estrogen estimations were not conducted.  The results, which confirmed those of a previous investigation, showed that pituitary inhibition was not produced despite long-term treatment and that, following medication withdrawal, the cycles reverted to an ovulatory pattern.  In at least 2 women, the pattern of urinary steriod in the first cycle after treatment was atypical.

[Provocation, delaying and inhibition of ovulation].

The effect on the menstrual cycle of various exogenous factors are reviewed.  Mechanical stimulation of the cervix and psychosexual factors have been reported to shorten the menstrual cycle.  Hormonal shortening of the cycle requires greater knowledge of the mechanisms involved.  Psychological and physical factors may also play a role in postponing menstruation.  In addition, administration of almost any sex-hormone-like substance at the beginning of the cycle produces a lengthened cycle.  Inhibition of ovulation may occur after physical or psychic trauma or after administration of estrogens and/or gestagens.  The estrogen-gestagen combinations used in oral contraceptives and their effects on endocrine and ovarian function and on the vagina and endometrium are discussed.  Treatment of menstrual disorders and sterility with hormonal ovulation inhibitors is also treated.

[Side effects of ovulation inhibitors].

Recent European literature on the frequency of side effects of ovulation inhibitors is reviewed.  Libido changes, gastrointestinal symptoms, weight gain, headache, breast discomfort, amenorrhea, premenstrual syndrome, jaundice, and breakthrough bleeding were commonly reported.  Although these side effects are quite frequent, the author points out that they are mostly minor, and that ovulation inhibitors are relatively harmless.

Effects of Anovlar on hormone levels and menstruation in 60 women aged 20-48 years are reported.  Anovlar was given on the 5th-25th days of the cycle; hormone levels were measured on the 10th, 14th, and 18th days.  No pregnancies were observed in the study, except in 1 woman who took the medication irregularly.  Menstruation began 1 or 2 days earlier than in untreated cycles.  Side effects included minor gastrointestinal disturbances, which disappeared quickly, and weight gain, observed in all patients.  The authors recommend close medical supervision of all women using hormonal contraception, and conclude that Anovlar is a very effective contraceptive with innocuous side effects.

Closed-chest massage: an effective resuscitative procedure for the maintenance of the circulation during cardiac arrest.

Reports of clinical benefits of closed-chest cardiac resuscitation refute recently published studies contesting its effectiveness.Our experimental investigations demonstrate that closed-chest massage is able to achieve adequate cerebral circulation and oxygenation during cardiac arrest.Clinical studies indicate that a significant number of coronary patients can be saved if a monitor system is used to warn of the onset of ventricular fibrillation or arrest. To be successful, closed-chest resuscitation must be instituted within the four-minute limit after onset of cardiac arrest. When ventricular fibrillation occurs, electrical countershock is usually obligatory. Cardiac pacemaking is a specific necessity for patients with ventricular arrest.

The treatment of hepatic encephalopathy by colectomy: case report and review of the literature.

A 64-year-old alcoholic patient with cirrhosis and bleeding esophageal varices developed hepatic encephalopathy following portacaval shunt. The etiology of this syndrome is believed to be related to the absorption of toxic nitrogenous substances derived from the activity of bacteria in the large bowel. Treatment consisted of a low protein diet, frequent purgation, and oral neomycin. Even on a 20-g. protein diet the patient deteriorated to a state approaching coma. Colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis was performed with good result. The patient remained alert and active with no recurrences of cerebral disturbance while enjoying a 60-g. protein diet. No additional treatment was necessary. The literature on colectomy in the treatment of this condition, while brief, reports similar good results. Further trial of colectomy is recommended for cases refractory to more conservative methods of management.

Effects of a combination of atropine, metaraminol and pyridine aldoxime methanesulfonate (AMP therapy) on normal human subjects.

Four hundred and seventeen medical students at the University of Toronto were used as both subjects and observers in a series of double-blind experiments to determine possible toxic effects following oral ingestion of various combinations of 2 mg. atropine, 10 mg. metaraminol and 1 g. pyridine aldoxime methanesulfonate (P(2)S). Heart rate, blood pressure, pupil diameter, and visual accommodation were measured before and at 20-minute intervals after drug administration for 100 minutes. A visual and memory perceptual test (Mackworth) was performed before and 100 minutes after drug ingestion.No toxic effects were observed following administration of the triple combination of atropine, metaraminol and P(2)S (AMP therapy). The AMP combination might be useful prophylactically for persons facing exposure to organophosphorus anticholinesterase compounds. It must not be considered an adequate substitute for treatment should poisoning occur.

[Thyroid suppression test].

A test in which thyroid function is suppressed was evaluated in regard to its ability to confirm the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism in borderline cases. An effort was made to establish a standard technique by determining the required duration of administration of tri-iodothyronine. Twenty-seven normal controls received tri-iodothyronine (T(3)) for a 10-day period, and 24-hour I(131) uptake was determined after three, six and 10 days. Twenty-two normal controls were similarly studied after four days of T(3) treatment. Twenty-one patients with an elevated I(131) uptake without goitre or toxicity, 10 with non-toxic goitre and 11 with toxic goitre were also studied. The T(3) suppression test was found to be particularly useful in distinguishing toxic goitre from euthyroid patients with an elevated I(131) uptake. Four days of suppression were found to be sufficient for purposes of evaluation in a large majority of cases.

Poisoning with organophosphorus insecticides.

Because of an increasing incidence of poisoning with the newer organophosphorus anticholinesterase insecticides, these compounds have been reviewed in terms of their history and pharmacology, relationship with other drugs, factors affecting toxicity, mechanism of action, toxic signs and treatment. The modern organophosphorus pesticide requires metabolic conversion before toxicity develops. Insects have a greater propensity for this conversion than humans. Nevertheless, this conversion does occur in humans and can be potentiated by other drugs. Toxicity also varies with age, sex, route and frequency of administration, and previous exposure. The mechanism of toxicity is inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, causing an intoxicating build-up of acetylcholine. Signs and symptoms consist of the clinical manifestations of unopposed parasympathetic and central activity. Treatment must be initiated early. Respiration must be maintained and the effects of acetylcholine must be counteracted by massive doses of atropine. Metaraminol enhances the antagonistic action of atropine against acetylcholine and may also be given. Once acetylcholinesterase is inactivated, restoration is slow. Recovery can be accelerated by enzyme reactivators like the oxime compounds. Pyridine aldoxime (Pralidoxime, Protopam, P(2)S and 2-PAM) can be given in combination with atropine and metaraminol (AMP therapy) and may be the treatment of choice.

[Hepatic steatosis and cholesterolemia in the domestic duckling in the course of protein malnutrition on a rice diet].

The object of this experiment was to study the influence of essential amino acids on the growth, fatty infiltration of liver and cholesterol level of the serum in ducklings.A 11 per cent protein basal diet, deficient in many essential amino acids, given to ducklings, resulted in poor growth, fatty infiltration of liver and high cholesterol level of the serum. In our experimental design, three amino acids, lysine, methionine and threonine were promoting growth whereas lysine and threonine were preventing fatty infiltration of liver but methionine failed to do so. Rather than a deficiency in lysine alone, simultaneous deficiencies in valine, arginine and lysine resulted in better growth for ducklings. This protective effect of deficiency in valine and arginine together with one in lysine was not effective against fatty infiltration of liver.The cholesterolemia found for the ducklings given basal diet or diets with deficiency in many essential amino acids was higher than that found for the ducklings given diets without essential amino acids deficiency.

Serum fractions inhibitory to the growth of Leptospires.

It is known that the growth inhibitory substance of animal sera on Leptospires exists in the albumin fraction. Since the globulin fraction obtained from animal sera having growth inhibitory property may support, though variable individually, some degree of leptospiral growth, it may be added, with 5% of pooled rabbit serum, to the medium to be used for the propagation of Leptospires.

Effect of injectable iron-dextran on dairy calves and lambs.

Ten Holstein calves, 10 Jersey calves, 7 single lambs, and one lamb from each of ten sets of twins were injected with an iron-dextran solution shortly after birth. These were paired with an equal number of untreated animals that formed the control groups. Percentage of hemoglobin and body weights were recorded periodically up to 16 weeks of age for the calves and 21 weeks for the lambs. Percentage of hemoglobin in the blood of treated calves was generally higher than that of untreated calves but body weights between groups were not significantly different. In the lambs there was no significant difference in percentage of hemoglobin or body weights between the treated and control groups. The results indicate that under the confined system of management as outlined, there was no advantage in administering iron-dextran to young calves or lambs.

A study of Toxoplasma infection in chickens and cats on a family farm.

Presumptive evidence of toxoplasmosis was obtained following histological and serological studies of tissues from chickens and cats kept on a family farm. This was confirmed by transmission of the infection to experimental laboratory animals and back to chickens. The significance of the low grade serological reaction in one of the persons living on the farm was not clear.

Recommended criteria for cardiac catheterization in patients with aortic valve disease.

Criteria for selection of patients with aortic valve disease for cardiac catheterization are described, based on a study of 81 cases. Children with aortic stenosis warrant catheterization at the time when the clinical diagnosis is made, but in adults this examination may be deferred until symptoms appear or left ventricular hypertrophy is recognized. In patients with pure aortic insufficiency catheterization may be deferred until symptoms appear. When severe stenosis and insufficiency co-exist, the valve is usually heavily calcified. Thirty-seven per cent of patients with aortic valve disease have co-existing mitral lesions and these patients are usually women, are fibrillating and, as a rule, have atrial enlargement in contrast to those with aortic valve disease only. On rare occasions, patients with mitral valve disease have clinically silent but angiographically demonstrable aortic insufficiency; therefore, aortography should precede open-heart correction of a mitral lesion so as to detect minor degrees of aortic insufficiency.

Surveys of respiratory virus antibodies in an Arctic Indian population.

A study was undertaken to determine the etiological agents responsible for epidemics in a small and relatively isolated Arctic community.Three serological surveys were carried out over a four-year period employing complement fixation tests. Clinical information from the resident nurse was also available.The results indicated that of the two clinical epidemics of "influenza" which occurred during the period of study one was due to influenza virus type A; the other was unidentified. However, influenza virus type B affected approximately 30% of the population at some time during a two-year period without being clinically recognized. An epidemic affecting mainly children, which was clinically considered to be whooping cough, was probably caused by an adenovirus. A mumps epidemic with a high attack rate for all age groups which had occurred a few months prior to the first survey was confirmed. Sendai virus and psittacosis virus are probably endemic in this community.

The epidemiologist's dilemma: a position paper on the role of epidemiology in Canadian research.

Canadian epidemiology is currently in transition from being primarily interested in infectious disease to becoming active in investigating causes of non-infectious disease. Generally, epidemiologists limit their work to "field", "basic", or "theoretical" epidemiology. In all three fields there appears to be a shortage of qualified personnel which is likely to become even more acute because of new roles that epidemiologists will probably play in the future. A minimum of 40 full-time epidemiologists is currently required in Canada.Departments other than departments of preventive medicine at medical schools and teaching hospitals are currently spending 79.5% of all funds allocated for non-microbiological epidemiological research in Canada. Since epidemiology is by its very nature population orientated, rather than clinically orientated, clinicians require consultative advice from epidemiologists at many stages of their research. Epidemiological facilities in departments of preventive medicine should therefore be strengthened in order to provide research training and didactic courses needed as the numbers of physicians, nurses and paramedical persons are increased.

[Idiopathic hypoparathyroidsm: provocation of a tetanic seizure by the injection of a mercurial diuretic].

Idiopathic hypoparathyroidism was diagnosed in a 55-year-old patient following rather unusual circumstances: he informed the emergency ward physician attending him for congestive cardiac insufficiency consequent to coronary cardiopathy that on the two preceding occasions when such insufficiency had been relieved by the injection of a diuretic, a tetanic seizure had ensued which was corrected by intravenous administration of calcium. Treatment of the cardiac insufficiency was nonetheless instituted with the mercurial diuretic: tetany appeared a few hours later, subsiding after intravenous injection of calcium. The various possible ways in which a tetanic seizure may be triggered by a mercurial diuretic are discussed.

Surgical treatment of tumours of the eyelids.

Sixty-five patients, in whom eyelid cysts and tumours were surgically excised and examined histopathologically, were followed up. The general principles of treatment are outlined. The procedures used in the reconstruction of the eyelids, which depended upon the extent of lid-loss; the results obtained; and the complications encountered, are described.Surgical excision with subsequent repair is preferred to radiation therapy in view of the unique accessibility, general low malignancy and infrequent metastases of these tumours. Such excision and repair produces a better cosmetic and functional result.

Congenital malformations and season of birth: a brief review.

Seasonal cycles in the births of infants with certain congenital malformations have been reported by several investigators.  There have been conflicting reports regarding months of greatest frequency of each group of defects.  Congenital malformations of the cardiovascular system have been noted to vary with seasonal infections of mothers with rubella.  Variations in other maternal infections during early pregnancy and the drugs given in treatment may be significant.  Sex differences have been noted, with congenital malformations of the musculoskeletal system more common in females.  Central nervous system malformations generally show a winter excess in frequency.  Some cardiovascular malformations seem to have a summer or autumn peak and be more frequent in female infants.

The consumption of an 800-calorie meal decreased the HCT and this effect lasted for six hours. In order to obtain comparable results blood for HCT should be taken in a "standard basal condition" in the morning hours, in the fasting state or after a light breakfast, and the patient should sit for at least 30 minutes before the blood specimen is taken.

The importance of the library in medical education.

The medical library assumes increasing importance to teaching and research. While funds for research, medical education, and improved facilities for patients have been increasing and are relatively easy to obtain, however, it has been extraordinarily difficult to obtain funds for the building and maintenance of medical libraries. The National Library of Medicine is attempting to preserve the record of medical knowledge and by means of mechanization provide more efficient service to physicians and scientists, but one, or a few, great libraries cannot serve the medical interests of the country. Federal support such as the program of grants in the proposed Medical Library Assistance Act is needed to assist local and regional efforts to improve library service.

Benjamin Rush and John Minson Galt, II. Pioneers of bibliotherapy in America.

The history of bibliotherapy in America goes back at least to the early part of the nineteenth century. Benjamin Rush was one of the first Americans to recommend the use of bibliotherapy; John Minson Galt, II, was the first American to write an article on the subject. Reading was considered one of the best therapeutic measures in treating mental patients, and by the middle of the nineteenth century every major mental hospital had a patients' library; many were quite extensive. Newspapers and periodicals were supplied in great numbers, and the works of Sir Walter Scott enjoyed great popularity.

Personnel administration: personnel problems in small medical libraries.

The shortage of medical librarians is felt most acutely by the small library, because the librarian's job may not seem challenging or the parent institution or organization is not willing or able to pay a competitive salary. The librarian's position often is filled, therefore, by an unqualified person, or a single professional librarian may have nonprofessionals as assistants. This paper discusses cooperative arrangements for sharing the service of a professional librarian and enumerates means of providing instruction for nonprofessional personnel.

Personnel administration: in-service training at the nonprofessional level.

A growing shortage of professional librarians has caused library administrators in all types of libraries to take a hard look at their interpretation of what constitutes professional work. The Free Library of Philadelphia is no exception, and in recent years it has evolved formal position classifications providing for the employment of nonlibrarians in positions formerly classed as professional as well as in the usual clerical and desk assignments. Conceived primarily out of necessity, these classifications and assignments are now readily accepted by the Library's staff, and there is little likelihood that earlier interpretations of professional and nonprofessional duties will ever be revived. This article outlines the Free Library's classification and training plan for nonprofessionals.

Personnel administration: the case method of teaching.

Only recently are case materials being used in the area of personnel administration, general library administration, and reference services. These permit more intellectual involvement on the part of the student than do the generalizations which result from the traditional lecture-discussion techniques. The medical library field has a professional character quite particular to itself. This is illustrated by its highly specialized clienteles, the quite special nature of the materials involved and their control, and the aura of special ethical considerations involved in any aspect of medicine. The development of a body of case materials would seem to have merit as a teaching vehicle for the medical library course, for in-service training in larger medical libraries, for workshops and institutes, and as a learning vehicle for the individual medical librarian.

Personnel administration: management of large medical libraries.

Machines themselves are not dehumanizing. Employed with proper management in total systems they enable us better to achieve human goals. Large libraries are complex systems involving man-machine relationships which must be studied with the new management techniques of systems analysis and operations research. Management science deals with a wide variety of problems encountered in the economy of the modern library. Librarians must know about these techniques if they are to fulfill their roles as managers of information services and systems. Good management also involves taking cognizance of the human factors in the old meaning of the term. Some parallels may be found between child rearing and personnel management, but the primary one is that managers must pay the same kind of thoughtful attention to their problems. Good management techniques may be learned empirically by trial and error, but they are better acquired systematically through consultation and study.

Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase: electrophoretic variants associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia.

Starch-gel electrophoresis of leukocyte alkaline phosphatases, rendered soluble by treating normal leukocytes with butanol, revealed three electrophoretic variants of the enzyme. The phosphatases in similarly prepared extracts of leukemia cells differed from the normal isozymes in electrophoretic. mobility. A single variant was detected in one case of untreated leukemia; a similar component and three additional ones were seen in leukemia treated with 6-mercaptopurine.

Erythrocyte membrane: chemical modification.

Erythrocytes treated with 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene become permeable to Na(+) and K(+), but not to small water-soluble nonelectrolytes hemoglobin, and eventually lyse inisotonic buffer. Erythrocytes treated with 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene become permeable to Na(+) and K(+) but do not lyse in buffer or in water, even after extraction with lipid solvents. The difluoro compound crosslinks the membrane and increases its strength. Both reagents appear to remove the positive fixed charge responsible for the cation impermeability of the normal cell.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase mosaicism: utilization as a cell marker in the study of leiomyomas.

The sex-linked electrophoretic variants A and B of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were studied in 86 samples of myometrium and 27 leiomyomas from five heterozygous women. All but one sample of myometrium had both A and B bands in equal or nearly equal amounts. In contrast to this, all of the leiomyomas had either an A band or a B band. Both A and B tumors were found in all uteri. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that these tumors arose from single cells.

Hormone-induced stabilization of soluble RNA in pea-stem tissue.

When indoleacetic acid labeled with carbon-14 in the carboxyl group is fed to excised green pea-stem segments, growth is initiated, and there is a parallel progressive labeling of the RNA extracted by cold phenol. The bulk of the label is found in the 4S fraction. This fraction is more resistant to degradation by ribonuclease than a similar fractian obtained from tissue not treated with indoleacetic acid.

Short- and long-lived messenger RNA in embryonic chick lens.

Cells of the embryonic chick lens pass through a definite sequence of macromolecular synthesis as they differentiate and migrate from one zone of the organ to another. Auto-radiographic studies of RNA synthesis and protein synthesis show that long-and short-lived messenger RNA's are both present in the lens.

Catalase: kinetics of photooxidation.

The kinetics of photooxidation of catalase is a four-step consecutive reaction, if each of the four porphyrin moieties acts independently. The rate of enzyme inactivation is a first-order reaction resulting from destruction of a single porphyrin. The kinetics of absorbancy is more complex, depending upon the absorption probabilities of each of the microspecies. With equal probabilities. the log of the sum of the normalized absorptivities is a linear function of time.

A note on the Philadelphia Regional Medical Library  Committee.

No rigid library plan can fullfil the needs of every region. The Philadelphia Regional Medical Library Committee, composed of representatives of the five medical schools, the College of Physicians, and other medical organizations, was formed to determine cooperative activities that best suit its own needs. The committee has reviewed plans for new libraries at several medical schools to avoid duplication of library resources. It envisions, also, cooperative storage of little-used materials, messenger service, an acquisition program to expand regional resources, improved communication by means of mechanical devices, and the establishment of a regional center and distribution of bibliographies from regionally located MEDLARS tapes.

Visual contours in homogeneous space.

With the aid of the Julesz figures, we introduce the concept of the stereoscopic edge, an edge which exists visually in the absence of physical contours. This edge, as well as the full complex of normal stereoscopy, can be present in the complete absence of physical contours at the fovea to approximately +/- 3.00 degrees from fixation.

Constitution, viability, and lactate dehydrogenase in stationary-phase L-cell suspension cultures.

Starved suspension cultures of L cells exhibit a plateau phase of short duration followed by loss of key cellular constituents and rapidly decreasing viability. In contrast, regularly fed,. undiluted cultures remain stationary at a high cell density for prolonged periods without structural alterations or loss of viability. The L cells contain a single lactate dehydrogenase isozyme with an electrophoretic mobility similar to that of lactate-dehydrogenase-5. High-density stationary cultures show a tenfold increase of the specific activity of this enzyme and a recurrent biphasic pattern of carbohydrate utilization with, first, production and, later, consumption of lactate.

Cellular origin of hyaluronateprotein in human synovial membrane.

Bright fluorescent staining, which indicates the presence of hyaluronateprotein, was observed in the lining cells of the synovial membrane following application of rabbit antiserum to hyaluronateprotein and a fluorescein-labeled antiserum to rabbit gamma-globulin. Staining was shown to be specific and due to antigenic determinants on or closely associated with the protein moiety of hyaluronateprotein.

Wasting disease induced with cortisol acetate: studies in germ-free mice.

A marked difference in mortality was observed between germ-free mice and conventionally reared mice, both given a single injection of cortisol acetate. The incidence of death in germ-free mice was significantly lower than in conventionally reared mice. Mortality in germ-free mice treated with cortisol acetate was in creased by monocontamination with Escherichia coli.

Hybridization experiments: evidence of dissociation equilibrium in hemerythrin.

Partial succinylation of hemerythrin alters its electrophoretic mobility even though it remains an octameric macromolecule. Mixtures of this modified protein and unmodified hemerythrin generate species of intermediate electrophoretic mobility. Such behavior provides strong evidence that the octameric macromolecule is in mobile equilibrium with monomeric subunits.

Synaptic connections of the centrifugal fibers in the pigeon retina.

The centrifugal fibers in the pigeon retina end in the inner nuclear layer and form two kinds of terminals, convergent and divergent. In the inner nuclear layer the fibers synapse with amnacrine and displaced ganglion cells. Because of their great number and their even distribution these fibers appear to constitute a system for the localized centrifugal control of the retinal functions.

Lymphocytic-choriomeningitis virus in hamster tumor: spread to hamsters and humans.

A passage line of a spontaneous hamster fibrosarcoma is contaminated by the virus. of lymphocytic choriomeningitis. Tumors from animals receiving implants when newborn contain high titers of infectious lymphocytic-choriomeningitis virus and complement-fixing antigen, and hamsters receiving implants when weanlings develop high titers of complement-fixing antibody against lymphocytic-choriomeningitis virus. In contrast with the specific reactions of tumorous hamsters to the initiating virus in virus-induced tumors, the development of complement-fixing antibody to lymphocytic-choriomeningitis virus does not depend on the development of tumors. Infant hamsters bearing the tumor have a generalized subclinical infection and seem able to spread virus to other hamsters and to humans.

Rabbit muscle lactate dehydrogenase 5; a regulatory enzyme.

Lactate dehydrogenase isozyme 5 from rabbit skeletal muscle is activated by citrate, cis-aconitate, isocitrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate, aspartate, and glutamate. In the presence of these activators the shape of the pyruvate saturation curve is changed from sigmoid to hyperbolic. Lactate dehydrogenase isozyme 1 from rabbit heart gives a hyperbolic pyruvate saturation curve and is not activated by these compounds. Oxalacetate is a competitive inhibitor of both isozyme 5 and isozyme 1 but at low concentration it activates the former. These results indicate that lactate dehydrogenase isozyme 5 from rabbit skeletal muscle is an allosteric protein and a regulatory enzyme, while lactate dehydrogenase isozyme 1 from rabbit heart is apparently neither.

Artificial menstrual cycles induced in ovulating women by monthly injection of progestogen-estrogen.

The article reports a study of the length and characteristics of menstrual cycles induced by a single monthly injection of 150 mg of dihydroxprogesterone acetophenide with 10 mg of estradiol ethanate (Deladroxate) administered to 60 regularly  ovulating women for a total of 198 cycles.  Cycle lengths are analyzed at length and the results are comparatively discussed in relation to the time of injection and cycle duration.  The duration and extent of menstrual flow is reported through 6 cycles.  The occurence of side-effects and the return to normal cycles are presented and discussed.  It is noted that the characteristics of artificially induced cycles were indistinguishable from normal cycles.  Recommendations for the most effective use of Deladroxate are given and further studies of the method are encouraged.

Chemical approaches to selective inhibition of viral multiplication.

There are more than 300 immunological types of viruses that infect man, but most are members of only eight major groups, each group characterized by distinguishing physical and chemical features. Chemical inhibitors have been discovered which are selectively directed against members of individual groups of viruses. These inhibitors interfere with virus-specific processes and have no effects on host cell metabolism at concentrations sufficient to prevent or stop virus multiplication. The biochemical basis of such selective action is understood in some cases. In addition, synthetic chemicals and biological products are known that inhibit members of several groups of viruses. The basis of their selective action is not clear.

Cerebrovascular occlusive disease. Experience with panarteriography in 300 consecutive cases.

Three hundred patients with cerebrovascular occlusive disease have had cerebral angiographic examination at the Veterans Administration Hospital, San Francisco, in the last five years. The present technique consists of preliminary visualization of the aortic arch and the major extracranial branches, followed by selective study of the subclavian and carotid arteries as necessary for evaluation of the intracranial circulation.Nine major complications occurred (an over-all incidence of 3 per cent). Two patients died after angiography and seven had major neurologic deficits persisting for more than 24 hours. Three of these patients had permanent damage, but four recovered completely.One-third of the patients had extracranial disease and one-third had intracranial disease. No significant lesion was found in the remainder. In the 212 patients with lesions, multiple lesions were common, the average number being three. Six patients had brain tumors and five had aneurysms. The mechanism of the stroke could be ascertained readily in most of the patients, but the extent of the disease and the resulting symptoms varied considerably. Several patients with occlusion of most of the cerebral vessels had minimal symptoms, while others had catastrophic symptoms but only minimal findings at arteriography.

Genetic counseling, a health department service to physicians.

Questions about inheritance in all kinds of diseases and defects are commonly asked of nearly all physicians. In attempting to answer these questions, however, the physician is often hampered by lack of formal instruction in clinical genetics. Since the health department, if it is to carry out its epidemiologic function, must be as concerned over the increasing identification of genetic agents in disease as it is and has been over environmental disease agents, it should come to represent a source of assistance not now generally available to the physician. In short, as it carries out those activities by which its store of general genetic information is increased, and until other sources of genetic consultation become reasonably available, the health department can be of real service to physicians as a resource to which they may turn for help when dealing with families wanting genetic information. Such a service has been provided experimentally for the last two years by the Contra Costa County Health Department. This program calls for the taking of family pedigrees by public health nurses on families with questions of a genetic nature who are health department clients and on families who are referred by their private physicians for this service. An interpretation of each pedigree is made by the department's physician in charge of the program and submitted to the family's physician for his use in counseling the family. Evidence to date suggests the process can be a highly useful service to the practitioner and his patient.

Acute rheumatic fever in Los Angeles County.

There was a general downward trend in the reported incidence of acute rheumatic fever in Los Angeles County during the years 1954-1963. A survey of hospital records in five large hospitals in 1962 revealed 100 cases diagnosed, 39 of which were reported. Diagnoses in the charts reviewed conformed to the Modified Jones Criteria. Most of the patients were born in Los Angeles County. Mortality rates for acute rheumatic fever during the same period were greatly in excess of those expected from the reported morbidity. The mean crude mortality rate for the period concerned was higher than for New York City, although not as high as for Boston.Acute rheumatic fever appears to constitute a health problem in need of review in Los Angeles County.

Pollen and mold spores. An atmospheric and field survey in Los Angeles.

A two-year survey of pollen and mold spores by the gravity slide method revealed that there are no clear-cut tree, grass or weed pollen seasons in California. Pollen counts should be correlated with field studies to distinguish the various plants whose pollen have a similar appearance. Spores of Alternaria and Hormodendrum, whose importance in allergic disease of the respiratory tract has been well established for many years, were found all during the year. More hormodendrum spores were collected than the total of all other pollens combined.

The deceptive acid phosphatases.

Determination of the prostatic acid phosphatase is, theoretically, a specific test for carcinoma of the prostate, but the present laboratory techniques have produced too many false positives and false negatives to be dependable. There may be inhibitors or enzymes that interfere with these tests. Until more exact enzymes are discovered, the present acid phosphatases should not be depended upon as a criterion for the type of surgical operation in carcinoma of the prostate, nor, without biopsy, should they be taken as an indication of prostatic malignant disease.

Lung cancer and month of birth.

A statistical study of possible relationship of month of birth to the occurrence of lung cancer was carried out at Veterans Administration Hospital, Long Beach. The distribution of the 200 lung cancer cases by month of birth did not differ significantly from that which might be expected by chance alone. These findings do not substantiate those found by Dijkstra in The Netherlands.

Platelet fibrinogen.

Platelet fibrinogen has been studied in normal, thrombasthenic, and hypofibrinogenaemic subjects. It has been differentiated into adsorbed (plasma) and extractable (intraplatelet) fractions. Isotopic studies suggest that exchange does not occur between intraplatelet and plasma fibrinogen and it appears possible that the intra-platelet fraction may be derived from the megakaryocyte. Six of nine thrombasthenic patients were found to have a severe deficiency of both adsorbed and extractable fibrinogen. Since the remaining three had near-normal platelet fibrinogen and all nine failed to aggregate it is improbable that the failure to adsorb fibrinogen is responsible for the defect in aggregation. Magnesium partially corrects adhesion to fibrin and clot retraction by these platelets, but has not been found to influence their fibrinogen adsorption. It is considered that the basic platelet surface defect, of varying severity, is responsible for the abnormalities of adsorption, aggregation, and adhesion in thrombasthenia. In the case of congenital hypofibrinogenaemia, fibrinogen transfusion corrects the long bleeding time, platelet-adsorbed fibrinogen, and the ability of platelets to spread on glass. It is possible that fibrinogen influences the surface properties of human platelets, although the final mechanism is not determined.

Localization of plasminogen activator in neonatal lung in the presence of hyaline membrane disease.

Necrotizing arteritis with giant cells associated with haemolytic anaemia.

Necrotizing arteritis with giant cells, involving the aorta, pulmonary and coronary arteries, and coronary, splenic, and renal arterioles was found at necropsy in a 74-year-old male who had died with severe haemolytic anaemia associated with cold haemagglutinins. The clinical and pathological features of this case are shared by well-recognized forms of necrotizing angiitis, in particular giant cell arteritis, but do not conform satisfactorily with any of these disorders. Cold agglutinin haemolytic anaemia in this instance suggests the possibility of an autoimmune aetiology.

Reversible absorptive defects in anticonvulsant megaloblastic anaemia.

Two cases of anticonvulsant megaloblastic anaemia are described, showing features of unusual interest. Though both cases were apparently deficient in folic acid, the Figlu tests were negative. One patient had an extremely low serum B(12) concentration apparently associated with defective B(12) absorption due to deficiency of intrinsic factor, and both showed impaired intestinal absorption of D-xylose. There was, however, no evidence of permanent gastro-intestinal dysfunction, and the absorptive defects disappeared completely after treatment with folic acid. Possible reasons for the findings are discussed. It is suggested that absorptive defects produced by the drugs may play some part in initiating anticonvulsant megaloblastic anaemia, and that once deficiencies of haemopoietic factors are established, a vicious circle may be set up owing to the effects of these deficiencies on the gastro-intestinal tract.

Enzymatic release of folate activity from the red cells in megaloblastic anaemia of pregnancy.

The content of folate activity precursors in washed red cells and the enzymatic plasma factor activity, necessary for the release of folate from the precursors, were studied in normal subjects and in patients with megaloblastic anaemia of pregnancy. Subjects with megaloblastic anaemia of pregnancy had a significantly reduced folate activity precursor content, and 14 subjects (58%) had significantly low plasma factor activity, which in at least four subjects may have been due to the presence of inhibitors. This study indicates that impaired activity of the plasma factor may play a part in the aetiology of megaloblastic anaemia of pregnancy.

Detection by paper chromatography of imidazoles, including hydantoin-5-propionic acid, in urine after histidine dosage.

Simple paper chromatography of urine obtained in the Figlu test has been found satisfactory for determining excess excretion of the imidazole metabolites of histidine. It has been confirmed that examination for these in addition to formiminoglutamic acid is necessary for a full assessment of this test. When excretion of the latter is not abnormal in folic-acid and/or vitamin B(12) deficiency, that of urocanic acid, a glycine conjugate of urocanic acid and/or imidazole propionic acid, is usually raised. An abnormally high excretion of hydantoin-5-propionic acid after histidine has also been found in these deficiencies, and its estimation may be of additional use in the evaluation of the Figlu test.

Simultaneous free and bound radioactive vitamin B-12 urinary excretion test.

The absorption of vitamin B(12) following the simultaneous administration of (58)Co B(12) and a complex of (57)Co B(12) with human gastric juice was assessed by measurement of urinary excretion of radioactivity. Sixteen control subjects, 13 patients with pernicious anaemia, and four who had had total gastrectomy were studied. The method proved a reliable means of detecting those with intrinsic factor deficiency.

A bacteriological study of non-chromogenic variants of Serratia marcescens from human sources.

The culture and biochemical features of 10 non-chromogenic variants of S. marcescens isolated from clinical sources are reported. Autoagglutination titres were significantly high in sera from those patients in whom Serratia bacilli appeared to contribute to the illness. Since the taxonomic stature of the Serratia bacilli is not clear it might be better to limit the identification of this group to Serratia species.

Neural and visceral xanthomatosis in adults.

The clinical, pathological, and chemical findings in a fatal case of generalized Hand-Schüller-Christian disease in a man of 33 years are presented in case 1. The necropsy examination revealed granulomatous infiltration of the infra-orbital fat, the pituitary stalk, and the posterior lobe of the pituitary and also of the skull bones and the thyroid cartilage. The spinal dura mater contained multiple xanthomatous deposits which had produced degenerative changes in the cord substance by epidural compression. Interesting features were the tumour-like enlargement of the right heart, massive pancreatic and renal infiltration, also heavy constricting xanthomatous mantles which had produced compression of both kidneys and adrenal glands. Case 2 is an example of xanthomatous granuloma, confined to the lungs, in a man of 57 years, and not associated with diabetes insipidus. The histological appearances were those of long-standing chronic xanthoma with marked cystic changes in the lungs, dilated bronchioles, and thick-walled stenosed pulmonary arteries. The pathogenesis of Hand-Schüller-Christian disease is briefly discussed.

Cerebral infarction due to intracranial sinus thrombosis.

Four cases, two infants and two adults, of extensive thrombosis of the intracranial venous sinuses are described. Infarction of the brain had occurred in three cases. The first two cases presented as diabetic coma. The third case has been included to represent primary puerperal cerebral venous thrombosis. Extensive venous sinus thrombosis was seen at post-mortem examination in the fourth case, an infant who died suddenly, but there was no cerebral infarction in this case.

Lipid studies in the blood and brain in multiple sclerosis and motor neurone disease.

The lipid patterns of plasma, red blood cells, and leucocytes from normal controls and from patients with multiple sclerosis and motor neurone disease have been studied by thin-layer chromatography. The fatty acid composition of cholesterol esters and lecithin in plasma from normal subjects and from patients with multiple sclerosis are reported. The fatty acid composition of lecithin of cerebral white matter from normal control subjects, from multiple sclerosis, and from motor neurone disease as well as of cholesterol esters in multiple sclerosis are recorded and compared. No significant abnormalities were found in the blood lipid profile in multiple sclerosis, but in motor neurone disease red cell sphingomyelin was slightly reduced and white cell lecithin slightly increased. The fatty acids of plasma cholesterol esters showed a slight decrease in palmitic and stearic acid in multiple sclerosis. The fatty acids in lecithin in multiple sclerosis, both in the apparently normal white matter and in the plaques, showed a slightly increased degree of saturation, while the loss of unsaturated acids was in oleic acids.

Systemic idiopathic fibrosis and systemic Weber-Christian disease.

Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis is represented as one of the manifestations of a widespread disease, systemic idiopathic fibrosis. Some evidence is presented which suggests its origin as an inflammatory disease of adipose tissue. Although relatively rare, the idiopathic diseases of adipose tissue and its blood vessels are worthy of closer study.

Gel immunofiltration: a new technique for the qualitative analysis of serum proteins.

The precipitin reaction has been used to locate serum proteins separated by thin-layer gel filtration on Sephadex G-200, thereby greatly increasing the sensitivity of the method. A pattern of lines reminiscent of immunoelectrophoresis is produced, but the proteins are separated in order of their molecular size and not in accordance with their electrical charge.

Serum enzymes in diseases of the thyroid gland.

Serum enzyme assays have been carried out in 66 patients suffering from diseases of the thyroid gland. Sixty per cent. of the hypothyroid patients had increased levels of aldolase and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, and 90% had high activities of creatine kinase. The significance of these findings, especially with regard to creatine kinase, is discussed.

Electrophoretic behaviour of human urinary amylase.

A saccharogenic method is described for estimating amylase activity in human urine. Results accord with those reported elsewhere except that in this study the peak in the beta zone is a new finding. Comparison between normal and pathological urines suggests that the amylase activity of the beta peak is not of pancreatic origin.

Release of formaldehyde from polynoxylin and noxythiolin.

Polynoxylin and noxythiolin (Anaflex and Noxyflex) have been recommended for the treatment of certain bacterial infections. Both compounds were shown to release formaldehyde. Detailed studies with noxythiolin showed that it decomposed in solution to liberate most of its formaldehyde, and that solutions of formaldehyde of the appropriate strength gave zones of inhibition on seeded plates comparable in size with those given by noxythiolin. It is suggested that the effects observed with these compounds are caused by the formaldehyde released.

Serial laboratory reports and records for chemical analyses.

A system of reporting laboratory data is described which provides serial and composite presentation of the results of chemical analyses as reports in the patients' notes in the form of copies of serial and composite records which are prepared and kept in the laboratory. The system has been used for seven months, providing reports for patients in 250 general medical beds, which generate an annual workload of approximately 90,000 chemical tests.

Cumulative reporting of chemical pathology.

A simple system for producing cumulative chemical pathology reports is described. Results of tests are transcribed onto the patient's laboratory record card and each time a new result is entered a copy is made by xerography and returned to the clinician as the laboratory report.A detailed account is given of the operation of the system and the design of the record card. The advantages of the system are enumerated and various problems that have been encountered are discussed.

Exchange of carbon-bound hydrogen atoms ortho to the hydroxyl group in tyrosine.

The carbon-bound hydrogen atoms of tyrosine that exchange with solvent protons in strongly acid solutions at about 100 degrees C are not the methylene hydrogen atoms but a pair on the aromatic ring. Of the two pairs of protons on the aromatic ring, observed in the proton magnetic resonance spectra, the pair at higher field undergoes exchange in 2.4N DCI at 100 degrees C. Other hydrogen atoms, attached either to aliphatic or aromatic carbon atoms, exhibit no noticeable exchange under the same conditions. From a chemicalshift analysis the exchanging protons are assigned as those ortho to the hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring.

Delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase activity in mice with hereditary anemia.

Homozygous (f/f) but not heterozygous (f/+) mice of the highly congenic strain, FL/ Re, manifest a severe transitory siderocytic fetal anemia. Adults of both f/f and f/+ genotype manifest decreased hepatic, splenic, and renal levels of triangle up-amino-levulinate dehydratase (ALD) activity compared to homozygous (+/+) mice of the same strain. The degree of augmentation in splenic ALD activity following phenylhydrazine administration is high in +/+, intermediate in f/+, and low in f/f mice. These findings suggest that perhaps a deficiency in the fetal level of ALD may be responsible for the transitory fetal anemia.

Gibberellic acid: action in barley endosperm does not  require endogenous auxin.

Endogenous auxin is not required for the increase in amylolytic activtiy induced by gibberellic acid in barley endosperm, as shown by the response of the system to anti-auxin. The action of gibberellic acid in this system is independent of the presence or absence of auxin.

Histones and basic polyamino acids stimulate the uptake of albumin by tumor cells in culture.

Basic proteins and polyamino acids are taken up by mammalian cells at rates up to 3000 times greater than serum albumin. When given together with serum albumin they increase the albumin uptake by a factor that correlates with their own rate of uptake and can reach more than 50-fold. The lowest threshold of activity detected (10(-10)M)is comparable to the activities of the most potent membrane-active agents.

Nucleoside phosphatases of fetal and maternal blood cells: electron microscope study.

Surface membranes of the blood cells located within the maternal blood sinuses of the rat placenta contain reaction products of nucleoside phosphatases. Fetal blood cells separated from maternal blood by the placental labyrinth show no activity during normal or prolonged gestation. Neonatal blood cells examined 34 hours after parturition show these enzyme activities.

Complement fixation on cell surfaces by 19S and 7S antibodies.

The mechanism of complement fixation on cell surfaces by whole antiserums, and by 19S and 7S fractions has been studied with a new comple-ment-fixation test. This test is based on the fixation and transfer of the activated first component of complement (C1a). We have concluded that a single molecule of 19S antibody in combination with antigen at the cell surface is sufficient to bind one molecule of C1a. For 7S antibodies at least two molecules in close proximity at the cell surface are required to fix one molecule of C1a.

Adrenaline and noradrenaline: relation to performance in a visual vigilance task.

Concentrations of adrenaline and noradrenaline in the circulating blood were measured in blood samples taken from subjects as they performed a visual vigilance task or viewed movies, both under identical conditions. For those subjects whose vigilance performance deteriorated it was concluded that the concentration of circulating adrenaline decreases as a function of time in a vigilance task but not under "relaxed" conditions, such as watching motion pictures. crementers under "relaxed"conditions.

Autocatalytic synthesis of a viral RNA in vitro.

Experiments with an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ("replicase") purified from Escherichia coli infected with an RNA bacteriophage (Qbeta) demonstrate that the enzyme generates a polynucleotide of the same molecular weight as viral RNA; the "replicase" cannot distinguish the polynucleotide from its own RNA genome. By starting reactions at input ratios below the saturation levels of template to enzyme, autocatalytic kinetics of RNA increase are observed. The data are consistent with the conclusion that self-propagation of complete viral genomes is occurring in this simple system.

Bone: formation by autoinduction.

Wandering histiocytes, foreign body giant cells, and inflammatory connective-tissue cells are stimulated by degradation products of dead matrix to grow in and repopulate the area of an implant of decalcified bone. Histiocytes are more numerous than any other cell form and may transfer collagenolytic activity to the substrate to cause dissolution of the matrix. The process is followed immediately by new-bone formation by autoinduction in which both the inductor cells and the induced cells are derived from ingrowing cells of the host bed. The inductor cell is a descendant of a wandering histiocyte; the induced cell is a fixed histiocyte or perivascular young connective-tissue cell. Differentiation of the osteoprogenitor cell is elicited by local alterations in cell metabolic cycles that are as yet uncharacterized.

Electrophysiological studies of chilean squid axons under internal perfusion with sodium-rich media.

Electrophysiological properties of giant axons of Chilean squid were examined by intracellular perfusion combined with various recording techniques. The amplitude of the action potential of the axons perfused with equal sodium concentrations (0.35M) on both sides of the membrane was approximately 75 millivolts (glutamate salts being used internally); the resting potential recorded with a calomel electrode was roughly 45 mv. These observations confirm and extend previous data, obtained from Chilean squid axons, which show that the amplitude of the action-potential overshoot does not agree with the Nernst equation applied to sodium ion. The discrepancy between these results and those obtained by others is attributed to differences in the procedures used to determine the resting potential.

Effect of gamma radiation on dietary and hormonal induction of enzymes in rat liver.

The dietary induction of serine dehydrase, produced by the oral intubation of hydrolyzed casein to protein-depleted rats, is markedly inhibited by doses of gamma-radiation of 400 roentgens or higher provided the irradiation is given within an hour after the initial dose of casein. If the irradiation is delayed until 7 hours after the initial dose of casein, induction is not inhibited. In contrast, the cortisone induction of tyrosine alpha-ketoglutarate transaminase is not inhibited by doses of gamma-radiation up to 3200 roentgens; in some instances hormonal induction of this enzyme appears to be enhanced by irradiation.

Collagen defect induced by penicillamine.

Collagen synthesis, as judged by the accumulation of collagen in a subcutaneous, induced granuloma, was significantly decreased by penicillamine. Penicillamine also caused a marked increase in the amount of soluble collagen in skin and a sharp drop in insoluble material. These findings, which reflect an abnormal pattern of collagen metdbolism, are accompanied by an inhibition of wound-healing and by skin fragility.

Antibody-complement complexes.

Soluble complexes containing the second and fourth compoezents of guinea pig complement, as well as hemolytic rabbit antibody, have been prepared by elution from sheep erythrocytes carrying these factors. These complexes render erythrocytes susceptible to lysis by the other factors of guinea pig complement, without the usual requirements for hemolytic antibody, Ca(++), and Mg(++).

Electronic separation of biological cells by volume.

A device capable of separating biological cells (suspended in a conducting medium) according to volume has been developed. Cell volume is measured in a Coulter aperture, and the cells are subsequently isolated in droplets of the medium which are charged according to the sensed volume. The charged droplets then enter an electrostatic field and are deflected into a collection vessel. Mixtures of mouse and human erythrocytes and a large volume component of mouse lymphoma cells were separated successfully. In tests with Chinese hamster ovary cells essentially all cells survived separation and grew at their normal rate.

Elevation in brain temperature during paradoxical sleep.

During ordinary sleep, the temperature of the rabbit brain tended to drop, but during paradoxical sleep it rose sharply 0.1 degrees to 0.4 degrees C, a greater elevation than was observed during arousal. Changes in body temperature generally did not parallel the alterations in brain temperature. Shifts of direct-current potential in the brain are basically independent of the changes in brain temperature.

Marmosets (hapiladae): breeding seasons, twinning, and sex of offspring.

Our records on marmosets, primarily Oedipomidas oedipus, plus data from the literature, confirm that these animals customarily have twins. Demonstrated chimerism for several tissues is significant, for virtually all twins are of biovular origin. Furthermore, a single birth may often be a survivor of twins. Births occur during any month, but springtime appears to be the most common period. An average interval of 240 days between births predicts the production level of a captive colony. A gestation period of about 140 days appears to be a valid estimate.

The optimum position for childbirth.

Postures adopted in childbirth for bearing down are varied today.  Bearing down causes an increase in intra-abdominal pressure which helps the expulsive phase of the uterus during labor, and this is brought about predominantly by the muscles of the anterior abdominal wall.  These muscles exert a compressive force when the thorax and pelvix are fixed.  In order for this to be done efficiently, the postural requisite is 2-fold.  The parturient must have all portions of her spine semiflexed--her shoulders should be raised about 6-10 inches off the bed and her chin should be flexed to come within about 2 inches of her chest.  2nd, while her thighs are flexed and parted, her feet must be firmly placed on the delivery table.  The assisting personnel must correctly support the parturient to avoid unnecessary exertion and tiring.  This position allows the parturient to push to the best of her ability and simultaneously to feel reasonably comfortable.  It also permits the attendant adequate access both to the perineum and to the abdomen and the fetal heart sounds.  The choice of this position as the optimum position is based on anatomical and physiological facts.  The fallacies underlying some aspects of present-day posturing are identified.

Stuttering. The effect of treatment with D-amphetamine and a tranquilizing agent, trifluoperazine. A preliminary report on an uncontrolled study.

In an institution for the mentally retarded, an uncontrolled study was made on the effects of d-amphetamine, d-amphetamine followed by trifluoperazine, and of combined d-amphetamine and trifluoperazine on stuttering. Of 28 patients to whom d-amphetamine was given, 14 showed improvement after one month's treatment. Eight more showed improvement when trifluoperazine was given for one month to those who did not improve on d-amphetamine. In many cases, improvement was sustained at least six months after treatment was discontinued. Treatment with d-amphetamine was apparently more effective in patients with functional than with organic retardation.

Ribosomes: analysis by cesium sulfate gradient centrifugation.

Ribosomes from the cytoplasm of a mammalian tissue, HeLa cells, were partially purified and then concentrated into a zone by prolonged centrifugation in Cs(2)SO(4) solution (density, 1.43 grams per milliliter). Ribosomal preparations treated with bentonite prior to density-gradient centrifugation showed single peaks after centrifugation. Material recovered from the peaks represented aggregates of the original 74S particle.

Reversible, light-screening pigment of elasmobranch eyes: chemical identity with melanin.

There lies directly beneath the tapetum lucidum, in the eyes of many elasmobranch fishes, a layer of darkly pigmented choroid cells which, in bright light, extend individual strands that aggregate to form a dark, compound curtain which shields the reflecting tapetal cells. This process is reversed in dim light or in darkness; the tapetum is exposed and visual sensitivity presumably Increased. The black choroid pigment has been isolated, analyzed, and shown to possess the properties of melanin.

Regulation of cockroach fat-body metabolism by the corpus cardiacum in vitro.

Incubation in vitro of young, adult, male Leucophaea maderae fat body with extracts of corpora cardiaca or intact corpora cardiaca results in stimulation of oxygen consumption but reduction in carbon dioxide evolved from carbohydrate. The carbohydrate is preferentially used for trehalose synthesis, and the endogenous metabolism of the fat body appears to be supported by increased lipid utilization. A hormone from the corpus cardiacum is most likely responsible for these effects and may act at two points, at least, in the glycolytic pathway.

Glycerol metabolism in the human liver: inhibition by ethanol.

Glycerol is metabolized predominantly in the liver, the first step presumably being phosphorylation to alpha-glycerophosphate. When ethanol is present in the blood the rate of glycerol uptake by the splanchnic organs is reduced to about one-third of the control value. At the same time glycerophosphate accumulates in the liver. Hepatic blood flow and oxygen consumption are not influenced by the combined infusion of glycerol and ethanol. The phenomenon may be connected with the increased concentration of the reduced form of diphosphopyridine nucleotide present in the liver during ethanol metabolism.

Rabbit sperm developed the capacity to fertilize ova when incubated in utero or in vitro in fluids from estrous uteri. Incubation of sperm with beta-amylase in phosphate-buffered Locke's solution also resulted in capacitation. The data suggest that sperm capacitation involves enzymatic alteration of carbo-hydrate-containing seminal macromolecules which coat sperm and inhibit fertilization.

Herbicide metabolism: N-glycoside of amiben isolated from soybean plants.

The N-glycoside of the herbicide 3-amino-2, 5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben) was synthesized in the laboratory. The compound was chromatographically identical with a conjugate of amiben isolated from soybean plants, Glycine Max (L.) Merr. The seeds of a tolerant plant, soybean, and of a susceptible one, barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), were incubated in amiben labeled with carbon-14, and the seedlings were extracted. Essentially all the radioactivity in soybean was present as a compound corresponding to N-glycosyl amiben. Only a small amount of this conjugate was present in barley; most of the radioactivity was present as free amiben or as other unidentified metabolites.

Lithocholic acid in human-blood serum.

Lithocholic acid was present in the serum of three patients with, jaundice and, in smaller amounts, in two healthy adults. This bile acid occurs naturally in human feces but induces cirrhosis of the liver when fed to a wide variety of experimental animals. The finding of lithocholic acid in blood is of interest because of its possible role in injuring human liver.

Template activity of RNA from antibody-producing tissues.

An RNA fraction, which represents a small percentage of cellular RNA and which has the characteristics of nuclear messenger RNA, has been isolated from the spleen and lymph nodes of immunized rats by successive phenol extractions of these tissues at increasing temperatures. This fraction increased the amount of protein synthesized in a cell-free extract of Escherichia coli as much as 35 times and directed the synthesis of proteins different from those of E. coli.

Collagenase: effect on the morphogenesis of embryonic salivary epithelium in vitro.

Salivary epithelium in culture, under conditions which promote morphogenetic branching, grows as a simple disc in the presence of collagenase, or is "depatterned" midway in the morphogenetic course by a short exposure to a collagenase.

Protein synthesis in rat liver: influence of amino acids in diet on microsomes and polysomes.

Rats were killed 1 hour after having been fed by stomach tube with amino acid mixtures that were either nutritionally complete or lacked tryptophan. Microsomes isolated from the livers of animals fed the incomplete mixture showed a reduced capacity to incorporate (14)C-leucine in vitro, and polysomes prepared from the same livers showed an increased proportion of monosomes and disomes. Prior treatment with actinomycin D did not prevent these differences in response to the two amino acid mixtures, an indication that synthesis of messenger RNA may not be involved in the cell mechanism which recognizes differences in amino acid pattern.

Spectrophotometer: new instrument for ultrarapid cell analysis.

A new device has been developed for measuring and displaying multiple spectrophotometric properties of biological cells at rates exceeding 500 cells per second. Preliminary observations of human cells from different sites in the body were made at wavelengths of 2537 and 4100 angstroms to estimate cellular nucleic acid per unit volume of individual cells of large populations of cells. Display patterns were obtained which were consistent, and characteristically different for certain of the cell populations studied.

Odorous secretion of normal and mutant  Tribolium confusum.

An autosomal recessive mutant characterized by "melanotic stink glands" has been found in the tene-brionid flour beetle, Tribolium confusum. The contents of the reservoirs of both pairs of odoriferous glands become modified in two ways as the beetles age. (i) The quinones (2-ethyl- and 2-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone) present in the secretion are reduced to 1/20 of that normally found in the wild type. (ii) The contents may be modified into a high-molecular-weight polymeric substance, which becomes visible through the exoskeleton and, upon dissection, appears as a black solid lump. The medium in densely populated cultures of the mutant becomes moldy while that containing normal beetles remains particulate. This difference suggests that one of the functions of the secretions of the odoriferous glands is to prevent the growth of fungi or bacteria in the nutrient flour.

Hydra: induction of supernumerary heads by isolated neurosecretory granules.

Neurosecretory granules of Hydra littoralis were isolated by differential centrifugation. Excised midsegments of hydra that were exposed to the fraction containing neurosecretory granules developed additional heads at any site, as they regenerated. Hence neurosecretory granules may contain a factot that regulates or stimulates growth in normal and regenerating hydra.

Soluble proteins of a melanoma and normal skin from the swordtail, platyfish, and their hybrids.

Acrylamide gel electrophoresis has been used to make comparisons of the distribution of soluble protein and the activity of esterase in skin and melanoma extracts of the swordtail, the platyfish, and their hybrids. There is a striking difference between the extracts of normal skin and tumor tissue derived from the same cytological elements. Several prominent protein bands are found only in the tumor tissue. Their origin and function are unknown.

Differential-approach tendencies produced by injection of RNA from trained rats.

Two groups of rats were trained in a Skinner box to approach the food cup when a discriminative stimulus (click or blinking light) was presented. Ribonucleic acid was extracted from the brains of these two groups of rats and injected into two groups of untrained rats. The untrained two groups then manifested a significant tendency (as compared with one another) to react differently to the two stimuli. On the average, the response appeared to be specific to the stimulus employed during training.

Nicotine: effect on the sleep cycle of the cat.

Small doses of nicotine (0.005 to 0.01 milligram per kilogram of body weight) given intravenously to sleeping cats with indwelling brain electrodes produce (i) initial electroen-cephalographic activation which was accompanied by behavioral arousal; (ii) a few minutes later, slow-wave sleep; and (iii) within 15 to 30 minutes, fast-wave sleep. Although peripheral afferent stimulation, release of epinephrine, and arginine vasopressin contribute to the initial arousal effects, the primary action of nicotine appears to be on the central nervous system.

Permeability of a nuclear membrane: changes during normal development and changes induced by growth hormone.

The ion permeability of the nuclear membrane envelope of salivary gland cells (of the midge Chironomus thummi) undergoes changes during development. Following the early fourth instar stage, permeability falls to about one-fifth of its base value over a period of 3 to 5 days of development of the animal, and then rises again over the next 2 to 4 days. The falling phase of the change can be reproduced within 1 hour by injections of the growth hormone ecdyson.

Messenger RNA in early sea-urchin embryos: cytoplasmic particles.

Three structures containing messenger RNA can be demonstrated in the cytoplasm of early sea-urchin embryos: (i) particles that sediment more slowly than ribosomes and contain newly synthesized DNA-like RNA, (ii) light polyribosomes, which also contain this newly synthesized RNA, and (iii) heavy polyribosomes, which seemingly contain only already existing or "maternal" messenger RNA and account for the bulk of the synthesis of protein.

</doc>
<doc>
Messenger RNA in early sea-urchin embryos: size classes.

Rapidly labeled RNA from four-cell embryos and blastulae of sea urchins was analyzed by sedimentation and for ability to form DNA-RNA hybrids. The RNA was derived from polyribosomes and from the "gel interphase," an extraction compartment resulting from treatment of whole embryos with phenol and known to be enriched with nuclei. The RNA from both sources displayed a high degree of structural complementarity to DNA. This DNA-like RNA of the polyribosomes sedimented in discrete classes, rather than in the sedimentation continuum demonstrable for the labeled RNA of the gel interphase. Thus messenger RNA appears to emerge in the cytoplasm in discrete size classes.

Bone density measurements in vivo: improvement of x-ray densitometry.

An X-ray bone densitometer has been developed which makes direct tracings of absorption curves on a nearly linear scale. Speed and precision are increased by elimination of x-ray film. Results are reproducible to within 3 percent with a phantom finger, and within 6 percent with human subjects.

Morphogenetic effects of 6-azauracil and 6-azauridine.

When 6-azauracil and 6-azauridine are fed to larvae of the tu(w) rc strain of Drosophila melano-gaster which has the normal wing shape, adults hatch with shortened, obliquely truncated wings. This wing shape resembles that of the mutant dumpy. On the other hand, administration of these drugs to the mutant dumpy strain increases wing length, and flies with normal wings are obtained.

Hemolysin of Mycoplasma pneumoniae: tentative identification as a peroxide.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae produces a soluble hemolysin active against guinea pig erythrocytes. This hemolysin appears to be a peroxide, since catalase or peroxidase inhibits its activity. The action of catalase and peroxidase is specific, since heating the enzymes abolishes their effect on the hemolysin. In addition, 3-amino- 1,2,4-triazole, a potent inhibitor of catalase, reverses the inhibitory effect of the enzyme. The hemolysin of M. laidlawii is also a peroxide. The hemolysins of M. pneumoniae and M. laidlawii seem unique for microbial organisms since the bacterial hemolysins which have been described have been protein or lipid in nature.

The linkage between the polysaccharide and mucopeptide components of the cell wall of Lactobacillus casei.

1. The linkage between the polysaccharide and mucopeptide components of the cell wall of Lactobacillus casei is rapidly hydrolysed under mild acid-hydrolysis conditions. 2. The release of the polysaccharide is accompanied by the hydrolysis of an N-acetylhexosaminide linkage. The N-acetylhexosamine residue readily forms chromogen and it is concluded that it is substituted on C((3)) by the adjacent sugar. 3. Continued heating of the polysaccharide in acid results in a slower release of reactive N-acetylhexosamine due to the hydrolysis of glycosidic linkages within the polysaccharide. 4. After the linkage between the polysaccharide and mucopeptide has been hydrolysed, acid phosphatase will release approx. 40% of the total phosphorus as inorganic phosphate. 5. It is concluded that the polysaccharide component of the cell wall is joined through its reducing end group to a phosphate grouping in the mucopeptide.

Properties of the polysaccharide and mucopeptide components of the cell wall of Lactobacillus casei.

1. The polysaccharide and mucopeptide components of the cell wall of Lactobacillus casei have been separated by mild conditions of acid hydrolysis. 2. Removal of the polysaccharide renders the mucopeptide susceptible to lysozyme. 3. The mucopeptide and polysaccharide components have been analysed and the results compared with those obtained previously. 4. The polysaccharides responsible for group specificity have a terminal reducing N-acetylgalactosamine residue substituted on C((3)) by the adjacent sugar; estimation of this component gave an indication of the molecular weight of the polysaccharides. 5. Evidence has been obtained for the presence of rhamnosyl-(1-->3)-N-acetylgalactosamine among the products of acid hydrolysis of the group B polysaccharide.

Studies on the biosynthesis of biotin. Production of biotin and biotin-like compounds by a pseudomonad.

1. Filtrates from cultures of a strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, grown in a basal glucose-ammonium chloride-vitamins-salts medium, possessed biotin activity as detected by microbiological assays. Exponential-phase culture filtrates contained biotin and desthiobiotin in the approximate ratio 1:3, with smaller amounts of biotin sulphoxide and three unidentified compounds with biotin activity. 2. The addition of malonate, adipate or pimelate to the basal medium stimulated the production of compounds with biotin activity; this effect was enhanced when these compounds were included in the medium as the major carbon source. Succinate, glutarate, suberate, fumarate or oxaloacetate did not stimulate the production of compounds with biotin activity. The ratio of biotin to desthiobiotin in filtrates from cultures grown in medium containing malonate as the carbon source was about 1:1. Experiments in which mixtures of malonate and pimelate were included in the medium as the carbon sources showed that these acids probably make a similar contribution in biotin biosynthesis. 3. A number of heterocyclic compounds, including several containing the ureido group (-NH-CO-NH-), were included in the basal medium but none of them stimulated the production of compounds with biotin activity to any marked degree. 4. Several amino acids, particularly cysteine (or cystine) and lysine, when added individually as supplements to the basal medium, stimulated the production of compounds with biotin activity. Filtrates from cultures grown in medium supplemented with cysteine contained approximately equal proportions of biotin and desthiobiotin. A much greater stimulation in the production of compounds with biotin activity was obtained when certain amino acids were included in the medium as the major source of nitrogen or carbon and nitrogen; ornithine, citrulline and argininosuccinate had the most marked effect. The ratio of biotin to desthiobiotin in filtrates from these cultures was usually greater than in filtrates from cultures grown in basal medium. 5-Aminovalerate also caused some stimulation when used as the nitrogen source, but urea was inactive. The effect of binary mixtures of certain amino acids was also examined. 5. The results are discussed in relation to the possible role of the stimulatory compounds during biotin biosynthesis.

Intestinal metabolism of fatty acids.

1. The effect of concentration on the oxidation and incorporation into lipids of lauric acid and linoleic acid by rings of rat small intestine has been studied in vitro. 2. In the absence of glucose, the oxidation of lauric acid in the range 0.01-5.0mm showed a maximum at 0.1mm. In the presence of glucose the maximum was at 0.5mm. The oxidation of linoleic acid in the presence of glucose increased throughout the concentration range 0.01-5.0mm. 3. The incorporation of lauric acid into lipids was maximal at 0.5-0.6mm in the presence of glucose, but at 10mm in the absence of glucose. At 0.8mm-lauric acid, in the presence of glucose, over 75% of the incorporated lauric acid was in triglycerides, but at 10mm they only contained 30%. The incorporation of glucose carbon into glycerides paralleled the incorporation of lauric acid. 4. In the range 0.01-2.5mm-linoleic acid the quantity incorporated into lipids increased. In the range 0.01-0.4mm linoleic acid was incorporated predominantly into triglycerides, but between 0.4 and 1.0mm most was in diglycerides, and between 2.5 and 5.0mm most was in monoglycerides. 5. The relationship of fatty acid concentration to the mechanism of absorption is discussed, together with the correlation between the distribution of the absorbed fatty acids within the tissue lipids and the lipase activity of intestinal mucosa.

Tritiated starch granules.

1. Surface-labelling of starch granules by tritiation seems feasible, and a technique is described that could be useful in structure determination. The impurities that are produced must be taken into account but the fact that a high polymer can be successfully tritiated seems very promising. 2. The surfaces of corn-starch granules must contain both amylose and amylopectin.

Effect of adenosine triphosphate on Perca fluviatilis sperm tails isolated in buffered sucrose.

1. Sperm tails were isolated from mechanically disrupted spermatozoa of Perca fluviatilis and suspended in buffered sucrose solution. When freshly prepared suspensions were treated with ATP and magnesium chloride and centrifugal pellets obtained these weighed up to about 40% heavier than controls. 2. The effect is closely linked to the enzymic splitting of ATP and under conditions where this was inhibited no increase in weight was observed. Pellets from suspensions aged overnight at 2 degrees and then treated with ATP and magnesium chloride were no heavier than the controls although the suspensions had undiminished enzymic activity. Sperm tails from Salmo trutta did not show the effect. 3. Analyses showed that the weight increases were the result of uptake of sucrose solution and that sucrose completely penetrated the pellet water. Polyethylene glycol (mol.wt. 4000) did not penetrate the water of the pellets completely and an amount approximately equal to 1.9 times the flagellar dry weight was inaccessible. 4. Electron-microscopic studies indicated that the effect is the result of tail disintegration.

Induction and multi-sensitive end-product repression in two converging pathways degrading aromatic substances in Pseudomonas fluorescens.

1. Control of enzyme formation has been examined in the pathways degrading mandelate and p-hydroxymandelate in Pseudomonas fluorescens. 2. The first three enzymes form a group which is common to both pathways and which is co-ordinately induced or repressed. The genes controlling these enzymes are assumed to form a ;regulon'. This group of enzymes is induced by mandelate or p-hydroxymandelate and repressed by benzoate and by p-hydroxybenzoate (the immediate end products resulting from the action of this group of enzymes). 3. Repression is independently exerted by end products of enzymes controlled by succeeding regulons, i.e. by catechol, by protocatechuate and finally by succinate and acetate. 4. The pattern is repeated further along the pathway, so that benzoate oxidase (controlled by the second regulon) is repressed by its immediate end product, catechol, and again by succinate and acetate. 5. Pyrocatechase, an enzyme controlled by the third regulon, is repressed by succinate and acetate. 6. There is a parallel system of multi-sensitive repression mechanisms controlling production of the enzymes that degrade the hydroxy compounds. Again, the enzymes of each regulon are repressed by the immediate end product of their action and by the end products of each succeeding group of enzymes. 7. Repressor activity appears to be exerted by compounds that are likely to occur as such in the external environment or that occur at points of convergence of the degradative pathways of the cell. 8. The net effect of this control system, involving both induction and end-product repression, appears to be that cells will not form inducible degradative enzymes if the end products are already being supplied from without or are being produced by degradation of some alternative source of carbon and energy.

Haemoglobins of invertebrate tissues. Nerve haemoglobins of Aphrodite, Aplysia and Halosydna.

1. The occurrence of haemoglobin in invertebrate nerves is surveyed. Haemoglobin was observed in the nerves and ganglia of the marine nematode Amphiporus sp. and of the polychaet annelid Halosydna sp. 2. Haemoglobins from the nerve and ganglia of the polychaet annelid Aphrodite aculeata L. and from the nerve of the gastropod mollusc Aplysia californica have been partially purified. The haem in each case was identified as iron protoporphyrin IX. 3. The minimum molecular weight of Aphrodite nerve haemoglobin deduced from the haem content and amino acid analysis is 17090, in agreement with the molecular weight 15600+/-1000 determined by sedimentation equilibrium. 4. The molecular weight of Aplysia nerve haemoglobin was determined by sedimentation equilibrium to be 16400+/-1000. 5. The oxygen dissociation curves are hyperbolic. Half-saturation is achieved at 1.1mm. Hg for Aphrodite nerve haemoglobin and at 4.0mm. Hg for Aplysia nerve haemoglobin. The coefficients for partition between carbon monoxide and oxygen are: Aphrodite nerve haemoglobin, 167; Aplysia nerve haemoglobin, 116. 6. The ferrous haemoglobins combine with cyanide. 7. We conclude that the intracellular haemoglobins of muscle and nerve are similar.

Ovoglycoprotein, a protein of hen's-egg white.

1. A description is given of the isolation of a glycoprotein from hen's-egg white; it has been called ovoglycoprotein. 2. It contains 13.6% of hexose, 13.8% of hexosamine and 3% of sialic acid. 3. Hexose occurs as mannose and galactose in the ratio 2:1, hexosamine as glucosamine and sialic acid as N-acetylneuraminic acid. 4. It has S(20,w) 2.47s and a minimum molecular weight, calculated from the tryptophan content, of 24400. 5. At pH3.9 in acetate buffer, I0.1, which is in the isoelectric region, it is resolved into two components, one of which moves slowly towards the anode while the other moves slowly towards the cathode.

Pyruvate metabolism by a nitrogen-fixing bacterium.

1. The major products of pyruvate dissimilation by washed intact cells of Achromobacter N4-B under nitrogen-fixing conditions are acetate and formate. The formation of succinate and isocitrate and the assimilated amino acids requires carbon dioxide fixation. 2. The products formed by cells incubated with pyruvate in an atmosphere of nitrogen were compared with those formed by cells incubated in an atmosphere of helium. Production of hydrogen and the formation of succinate were greater under helium than under nitrogen. Production of acetate and formate and the utilization of pyruvate were the same in both atmospheres. 3. Cell-free preparations, unlike intact cells of Achromobacter N4-B, do not evolve hydrogen, but do produce lactate. 4. It is suggested that, in cell-free preparations incapable of fixing nitrogen, electrons are accepted from pyruvate to form lactate rather than being used for the reductive formation of ammonia and hydrogen.

A spectrofluorimetric study of the 7-hydroxylation of coumarin by liver microsomes.

1. The fluorescence characteristics of 3- and 7-hydroxycoumarin, and 7-hydroxy-and 7-methoxy-4-methylcoumarin, have been determined. 7-Hydroxycoumarin shows excited-state ionization from pH1 to 9. 2. A sensitive and specific fluorimetric method for the determination of 7-hydroxycoumarin (umbelliferone), and its application to liver homogenates and other tissue preparations, are described. 3. The enzymic hydroxylation of coumarin to 7-hydroxycoumarin has been studied by this method and the optimum conditions have been determined for rabbit-liver preparations. The enzymic activity was found in the microsomal fraction and required NADPH(2) and oxygen. Activity with NADH(2) was one-third of that with NADPH(2). 4. Addition of NADP was necessary for full activity of 10000g supernatant preparations of liver. Nicotinamide added during preparation preserved coenzymic activity in tissue stored at -12 degrees . Glucose 6-phosphate had no effect on the activity of stored or fresh tissue. 5. Inhibition occurred with p-chloromercuribenzoate, and with the usual inhibitors of the microsomal drug-metabolizing enzymes, SKF acid, SKF 525A, and Lilly 7132, but not with 2,2'-bipyridyl. 6. Liver homogenates from rabbit, guinea pig, coypu, cat and pigeon showed activity, but preparations of rat or mouse liver, and of locust fat bodies, did not hydroxylate coumarin to umbelliferone. The enzyme system was absent from rat-liver homogenates and microsomal preparations. Moreover, rat liver also contained inhibitors of the rabbit-liver coumarin-7-hydroxylase system and of the further metabolism of umbelliferone by guinea-pig liver. Guinea-pig-liver preparations hydroxylated coumarin to umbelliferone and then converted this product into its glucuronide. 7. The coumarin-7-hydroxylase activity of female rabbit liver was two to three times that of male rabbit liver.

The effect of beta-sitosterol on the metabolism of cholesterol and lipids in rats on a diet containing coconut oil.

1. Intraperitoneal injection of beta-sitosterol (5mg./rat/day for 25 days) into 1-year-old male Wistar rats fed on a low-fat diet supplemented with 10% of coconut oil resulted in a lowering of cholesterol and lipid concentrations in the tissues. 2. beta-Sitosterol increased the rate of biosynthesis of cholesterol and lipids in the tissues, but to an even greater extent enhanced their oxidative degradation. 3. The present results are similar to those previously obtained on a low-fat diet, indicating that the presence of fat had no marked effect on the action of beta-sitosterol.

The localization of adenosine triphosphatases in morphologically characterized subcellular fractions of guinea-pig brain.

1. The distribution of adenosine triphosphatase was studied in morphologically characterized subcellular fractions of guinea-pig brain. The conditions of homogenization were selected so as to favour the survival of nerve endings as organized structures. 2. A fraction consisting mainly of the external membranes of nerve endings was rich in a ouabain-sensitive Na(+)-K(+)-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase which closely resembled that present in the classical microsomal fraction studied by other workers, but which showed a higher specific activity. 3. A dinitrophenol-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase was located in the nerve-ending mitochondria. 4. The synaptic-vesicle fraction contained a small amount of adenosine triphosphatase that differed in its response to several ions and other compounds from the membrane, myelin and mitochondrial fractions, indicating freedom from contamination by these elements.

The preparation of rabbit renin-substrate for the assay of minute amounts of renin.

1. By DEAE-cellulose chromatography and treatment with Cd(2+) a partially purified renin-substrate has been prepared from rabbit serum. 2. It has the following properties: (a) Angiotensinase activity is undetectable: 0.1mug. of angiotensin was recovered intact after incubation with the substrate at 37 degrees for 200hr. (b) It does not contain renin and does not generate vaso-active substances when incubated alone. (c) It is ten times as active as serum in terms of angiotensin produced/mg. of protein. (d) It has not deteriorated after storage for 3 months at 4 degrees at pH7.5.

The effect of treatment of rats with pituitary growth hormone on the activities of some enzymes involved in fatty acid degradation and synthesis.

1. Measurements have been made of the activities of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, enoyl-CoA hydratase, beta-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and ketothiolase in the livers of rats treated for either 12hr. or 3 days with pituitary growth hormone. 2. There was a significant increase in the activity of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase in rats treated with the hormone for 3 days. 3. Measurements were also made of the lipogenic enzymes acetyl-CoA carboxylase and palmitate synthase in the livers of similarly treated animals. 4. There was a depression of the activity of both enzymes after 12hr. treatment and a further decline after 3 days. 5. The results are discussed in relation to the known increase in the rate of fatty acid oxidation and inhibition of fatty acid synthesis in rats treated with growth hormone.

Studies on the structure of lipopolysaccharides of Salmonella minnesota and Salmonella typhimurium R strains.

1. The composition of the lipopolysaccharides and the corresponding lipid-free polysaccharides from four R-mutants of Salmonella has been studied. All the lipopolysaccharides, from RI and RII serotypes contained d-glucose, d-galactose, heptose, N-acetylglucosamine and 3-deoxy-2-oxo-octonate. The polysaccharide obtained from the RII lipopolysaccharides also contained all these sugars. The polysaccharides from RI lipopolysaccharides lacked N-acetylglucosamine. 2. From partial hydrolysates of the lipopolysaccharides, a number of oligosaccharides have been isolated and partially characterized. Oligosaccharides containing N-acetylglucosamine or glucosamine were obtained only from RII lipopolysaccharides. Several oligosaccharides composed of glucose and galactose were common to RI and RII preparations. 3. A structural unit, based on the oligosaccharides found, is proposed for the RII lipopolysaccharide. It contains the sequence: alpha-N-acetylglucosaminyl- alpha-glucosyl-alpha-galactosyl-glucosyl.... A second alpha-galactosyl residue is bound to position 6 of the last glucosyl group. The complete unit is believed to to be attached to a polyheptose phosphate backbone in the RII antigen. 4. The RI lipopolysaccharide of Salmonella minnesota contains an analogous structure lacking the terminal N-acetylglucosamine residue. 5. A basal structure common to the lipopolysaccharides of several Salmonella species is proposed.

The composition and physicochemical properties of hyaluronic acids prepared from ox synovial fluid and from a case of mesothelioma.

1. Materials containing hyaluronic acid have been prepared by filtration (Ogston & Stanier, 1950) from ox synovial fluid and from a protein-rich human mesothelioma fluid. The ox material has been deproteinized by treatment with chloroform and pentanol and by gradient elution on DEAE-Sephadex; several fractions were obtained by the latter method. These materials can be stored in solution at -20 degrees without change of properties. The ox material contained 21% of protein; all other preparations contained less than 6% of protein. 2. The two materials have been compared by sedimentation and viscosity and shown to be closely similar. Treatment of the ox material with neuraminidase caused no change in its viscosity behaviour. 3. Information about the molecular configuration of the ox material has been obtained from measurements of light-scattering and viscosity. The results, though consistent with a highly extended configuration, are not consistent with a linear random-coil configuration. It is tentatively suggested that the structure may have some degree of branching and of cross-linking, which give it a rigidity with respect to expansion of the molecular domain that would not be possessed by a random coil. 4. The deproteinized material recovered from DEAE-Sephadex, though polydisperse, showed unchanged average molecular weight; however, the average radius of gyration was greater than before this treatment. 5. Acidification to approx. pH3 resulted in a contraction of the structure, with only a slight degree of expansion when the pH was restored to 6.8-7.0. 6. Measurements of optical rotatory dispersion qualitatively support a structure less simple than a linear random coil. 7. Colloid osmotic pressures of mixed solutions of bovine serum albumin and of hyaluronic acid prepared by filtration from ox synovial fluid have been measured. The results agree approximately with those of Laurent & Ogston (1963) but are in quantitative disagreement with the partition measurements of Ogston & Phelps (1960). The relationships between thermodynamic quantities in a quaternary system of electrolytes are discussed in Appendix 2. 8. Refractometric measurements have been made in connexion with light-scattering measurements, as the basis for a convenient method of determining the concentrations of solutions of hyaluronic acids, and to measure the partition of sodium chloride in dialysis experiments. The theory of the last use is discussed in Appendix 1. 9. Sedimentation measurements on the ox preparation have been made up to a concentration of 1.4x10(-2)g./ml. The form of the sedimentation coefficient-concentration relationship is discussed. The value of the sedimentation coefficient at higher concentration is the basis of an illustration of the likely effect of hyaluronic acid on the flow of water through narrow channels in connective tissue. 10. Available colorimetric methods have been shown to give low estimates for glucuronic acid when applied to highly polymerized materials, as compared with estimates by decarboxylation. A spectrophotometric titration with cetylpyridinium bromide has been shown to give estimates of carboxyl groups that agree well with those of decarboxylation when applied to preparations of hyaluronic acid under suitable conditions; the results are not affected by the presence of protein. 11. Estimates of glucosamine (Ogston, 1964) have been found to be low compared with those of total acetyl, independently of the presence of protein. The magnitude of the discrepancy is characteristically different for preparations from ox synovial fluid and from mesothelioma. 12. Sialic acid was estimated in several preparations. It is likely that this forms part of the protein. 13. Analyses of preparations for total nitrogen, amino acids, total acetyl, glucuronic acid (by decarboxylation) and ash account for at least 95.7% of the dry weight in terms of N-acetylglucosaminyl, glucuronyl, protein and metal ions. Previously published analyses of hyaluronic acids are reviewed. 14. The estimated molar ratios of glucuronic acid to glucosamine were all significantly greater than unity. 15. The analytical results are interpreted as agreeing with the physicochemical measurements in suggesting a more complex structure, for at least some hyaluronic acids, than that of an alternate linear copolymer in random-coil configuration.

Vitamin D3 and calcium absorption in the chick.

1. An attempt has been made to locate the site of action of vitamin D(3) as it affects the translocation of calcium across the intestine. 2. Calcium appears to be pumped out of cells by a process dependent on energy from metabolism. 3. The effects of cold, inhibitors and vitamin D(3) on the translocation of calcium by everted sacs of intestine were studied and compared with results obtained in vivo. 4. A model was proposed to explain the results which suggests that vitamin D(3) inhibits a metabolically operated pump that returns calcium from the mucosal cell to the lumen. 5. Some observations on the effect of sodium lauryl sulphate on the translocation of calcium in vivo and in vitro are reported.

Changes in lysosomal enzymes in acute experimental liver injury.

1. An investigation has been made of the changes occurring in lysosomal enzyme activities during the early development of experimentally produced liver injury in the rat. Three enzymes have been studied: acid phosphatase, acid ribonuclease and beta-glucuronidase. Four different methods of inducing liver injury have been used: administration of carbon tetrachloride, thioacetamide, dimethylnitrosamine and the fungal toxin sporidesmin. 2. The majority of the data presented concern alterations produced by carbon tetrachloride. Despite the extensive central necrosis and accompanying fat accumulation which this poison produced in the liver, only small changes in the activity and latency of lysosomal enzymes could be detected. In the early (pre-necrotic) period of injury these changes were insignificant. At a late stage of injury, when extensive centrilobular necrosis was present, there were indications of lysosomal rupture. 3. The results obtained with the other three hepatotoxins were similar to those described for carbon tetrachloride in that no evidence of early lysosomal rupture was obtained during the pre-necrotic period. It is concluded that lysosomes probably play no role in the early development of the four types of liver injury studied but, instead, are involved in later scavenging processes.

Activity of beta-galactosidase in homogenates and isolated microvilli fraction of jejunal mucosa from suckling rats.

1. beta-Galactosidase activity was studied in homogenates and isolated microvilli fraction of jejunal mucosa from 14-day-old suckling rats. o-Nitrophenyl beta-d-galactoside served as the substrate. 2. The microvilli fraction contains about one-third of the total activity of the original homogenate. 3. The pH optimum of the beta-galactosidase was 3.5 in the total homogenate and supernatant fraction, whereas in the microvilli fraction the maximum activity was at pH5.5. 4. This work gives further support to the view that two beta-galactosidases exist in the jejunal mucosa.

Incorporation of 14C-labelled fatty acids into the mammary-gland lipids of the lactating rabbit.

1. [1-(14)C]Stearic acid, [9-(14)C]stearic acid, [9-(14)C]palmitic acid and [9-(14)C]decanoic acid were fed to lactating rabbits, and the fatty acids of the mammary gland were separated and partially degraded. 2. Most of the (14)C recovered was located in the acids fed. Stearic acid was least efficiently absorbed; decanoic acid was the most extensively metabolized. 3. Resynthesis after degradation to C(2) units led to uniform alternate labelling in the C(2)-C(10) acids, whereas C(12)-C(18) acids had excess of (14)C at the carboxyl end. 4. Acids formed by beta-oxidation down to C(12), but not below, were also present in the mammary-gland lipids. Desaturation of the administered acids was a very minor reaction.

A comparison of methods for the isolation and fractionation of reticulocyte ribosomes.

1. Polysomes, ribosomes and pH5 enzymes were isolated from rabbit reticulocytes by acidifying the post-mitochondrial supernatant to pH6.0 to precipitate all ribonucleoprotein particles and about half the pH5 enzymes; the precipitate was redissolved in buffer, pH7.6, and fractionated by zone centrifuging. 2. The isolation of polysome-rich and ribosome-rich fractions from the post-mitochondrial supernatant was also examined. 3. Studies of the stability of polysomes revealed that dissociation into sub-units occurred when both bound and free Mg(2+) was chelated by EDTA or when the pH was increased above pH8.8.

The activities of nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase and of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide kinase in the livers of rats subjected to different hormonal treatments.

1. The activities of NMN adenylyltransferase and of NAD(+) kinase have been measured in the livers of adrenalectomized or alloxan-diabetic rats and in the livers of rats treated with glucagon, pituitary growth hormone or thyroxine. 2. The activities of these enzymes have been compared with the effects of the same treatments on the nicotinamide nucleotide concentrations in the liver. 3. Alloxandiabetes (+37%) and thyroxine (+27%) both increased the activity of NMN adenylyltransferase. The other treatments were without effect on this enzyme. 4. Only thyroxine increased the activity of NAD(+) kinase significantly (+26%) although both adrenalectomy and glucagon tended to increase its activity. 5. The activity of NAD(+) glycohydrolase was measured in the livers of diabetic rats, and in the livers of rats treated with either growth hormone or thyroxine. Of these treatments, only growth hormone altered the enzyme activity (+26%, calculated on a total hepatic activity basis). 6. Female rats had a greater hepatic NAD(+)-kinase activity than males but there was no sex difference with respect to NMN adenylyltransferase. 7. The lack of correlation between the maximum potential activity of these three enzymes and the known changes of the nicotinamide nucleotides in each of the hormone conditions is discussed.

The biosynthesis of streptomycin. The origin of the C-formyl group of streptose.

1. The biosynthesis of streptomycin in Streptomyces griseus has been studied by adding d-[3,4-(14)C(2)]glucose or d-[1,3-(14)C(2)]glucose to the growth medium and degrading the streptomycin produced. 2. The results suggest that the C-3' branch carbon atom of l-streptose arises from C-3 of d-glucose. 3. The mechanism of biosynthesis of streptose from glucose is discussed. It probably involves an intramolecular rearrangement of a 6-deoxy-4-oxyhexose derivative, and it is suggested that the nucleoside diphosphate sugar derivative hitherto recognized as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of l-rhamnose might participate in such a rearrangement.

Studies on the metabolism of the protozoa. The molecular structure of a starch-type polysaccharide from Polytoma uvella.

1. Polytoma uvella, when grown in an acetate-containing medium, synthesizes a starch-type polysaccharide. 2. The starch differs from normal plant starches in having a lower iodine affinity, and in being relatively insoluble; this latter property makes fractionation difficult. 3. The starch contains about 16% of amylose, and on fractionation yields a branched amylopectin component that is similar in structure to a typical plant starch amylopectin.

Biosynthesis of pulcherriminic acid.

1. Candida pulcherrima was grown on a complex medium to which various compounds had been added to determine their effect on the biosynthesis of pulcherriminic acid. Most of the pulcherriminic acid synthesized by C. pulcherrima PRL2019 was derived from the l-[1-(14)C]leucine added to the medium. 2. The cyclic dipeptide of l-leucine (cyclo-l-leucyl-l-leucyl) was shown, by trapping experiments involving cycloleucyl-leucyl isomers, to be synthesized by strain PRL2019. Cyclo-l-leucyl-l-leucyl was derived from l-leucine and was converted into pulcherriminic acid. Cyclo-l-leucyl-l-leucyl was a precursor of pulcherriminic acid in strain PRL2007 also. 3. The results supported the hypothesis that pulcherriminic acid is derived from l-leucine and that cyclo-l-leucyl-l-leucyl is an intermediate in the biosynthesis.

The role of vitamin B12 in the metabolism of Euglena gracilis var. bacillaris.

1. The concentrations of RNA, DNA and protein are decreased in cells of Euglena gracilis var. bacillaris grown on suboptimum concentrations of vitamin B(12). 2. The addition of vitamin B(12) to deficient cells stimulates the incorporation of [(14)C]formate into the above cell components as well as into thymine of DNA and serine and methionine of protein. 3. In a cell-free system from vitamin B(12)-deficient cells, the incorporation of labelled formate into thymidylate is decreased to a greater extent with uridine than with deoxyuridine as the substrate. 4. The addition of unlabelled glutamate dilutes the radioactivity incorporated into thymine from labelled formate. 5. These results are interpreted to mean that, in DNA synthesis, vitamin B(12) has a greater role in the reduction of ribotides to deoxyribotides than in the reduction of formate to thymine methyl and that the vitamin B(12)-dependent conversion of glutamate into beta-methylaspartate also contributes to thymine synthesis.

Dehydrogenation of androsterone by purified 3-alpha-hydroxy steroid-dependent nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (phosphate)-transhydrogenating enzyme of rat liver.

1. An enzyme from rat liver, catalysing 3alpha-hydroxy steroid-dependent NAD(P) transhydrogenation and NAD-linked and NADP-linked dehydrogenation of 3alpha-hydroxy steroids, has been purified 100-fold by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and calcium phosphate gel. 2. No separation of these activities into different protein fractions has been achieved. 3. The properties of the enzyme in catalysing NAD-linked and NADP-linked dehydrogenation have been compared, with androsterone as substrate. Differences were found in pH optima, affinity for coenzyme and steroid, equilibrium constants and effects of salts. 4. NAD-linked dehydrogenation is inhibited by NADPH(2) but is protected from this inhibition by chloride, which alone is itself an inhibitor. 5. The relevance of these findings to the problem of the number of enzymes involved in catalysis of 3alpha-hydroxy steroid-dependent transhydrogenation is discussed.

An extracellular glycolipid produced by Escherichia coli grown under lysine-limiting conditions.

1. Some of the products excreted by cultures of lysine-requiring Escherichia coli A.T.C.C. 12408 grown under lysine-limiting conditions have been studied. 2. A glycolipid designated ;extracellular lipoglycopeptide' was prepared from culture filtrates of such organisms. It contained 35% of lipid, 19% of carbohydrate, 3.4% of P and 3.7% of N. 3. Comparison of the lipids, fatty acids, carbohydrates and amino acids of this lipoglycopeptide with those of whole cells, cell walls and cellular lipopolysaccharides shows that it has few features (except its residual lipids) in common with any of these fractions. 4. The lipoglycopeptide was antigenically related to both walls and lipopolysaccharide.

Total body scanning with strontium-85 in the diagnosis of metastatic bone disease.

To demonstrate skeletal metastases before radiographic changes were apparent, Sr(85) scans were carried out on 46 patients who complained of sketetal pain but whose radiographs were negative. Positive scans were obtained in 34 patients, 20 of whom were subsequently shown to have metastases; three did not have skeletal metastases a year or more later; the outcome is unknown in 11 patients. Twelve patients had negative scans: three ultimately developed metastases, six did not, and three were inconclusive. Autoradiographs demonstrated Sr(85) concentrations in areas of reactive osteogenesis.Although not specific for skeletal metastases, Sr(85) scans are most helpful in substantiating this diagnosis when radiographic changes are absent.

Adrenocortical hyperfunction associated with bronchogenic carcinoma: report of five cases.

Five patients with bronchogenic carcinoma associated with adrenocortical hyperfunction are described. The clinical features, laboratory studies and autopsy findings are discussed and compared with previously reported cases. Four patients presented most of the typical features of this disorder as previously described, whereas the fifth was atypical in some respects. Typical features included: acute onset of adrenocortical hyperfunction in a middle-aged male, rapid downhill course, slight or absent physical signs of Cushing's syndrome, frequently impaired glucose tolerance, markedly elevated plasma and urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids not suppressed by exogenous steroids, absent diurnal variation of plasma corticoids, hypokalemic alkalosis with normal aldosterone excretion, and tumour histology of the oat cell variety. The adrenal glands of two patients were of normal or slightly increased weight, and mean 17-ketosteroid excretion values were normal in three; this contrasts with the marked increase in adrenal weight and 17-ketosteroid excretion in most reported cases.

Observations on immunochemical assays of human chorionic gonadotropin.

Commercial immunochemical tests, "UCG" and "Prepuerin", detected standardized human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) in concentrations comparable to the rat ovarian hyperemia test. These in vitro systems also cross-reacted with pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) but not with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) of animal origin. The latex agglutination slide tests required a higher concentration of HCG for a positive test than did the bioassay. In cases of abnormal pregnancies the immunochemical assays remained positive longer than the bioassay, which is apparently due to their detection of biologically inactive HCG. Several non-pregnant patients with ovarian cysts and cystic teratomas excreted in their urine some substances which reacted with the UCG test. After surgical removal of the tumour these substances disappeared from the urine.

Photostatic reporting in a hospital bacteriology laboratory.

A method of reporting results of tests performed in a hospital bacteriological laboratory is described in which a modified commercially available electrostatic copier is used. This device was designed for a hispital system in which more than one report per specimen is issued and in which rubber stamps are widely used and frequently changed. It has been working satisfactorily for more than six months. It increases accuracy and saves time and money. Attention to the clarity of reproduction is necessary. It is suggested that this system could be modified for other laboratory reporting systems.

Pilonidal disease--a surgical enigma.

A retrospective review of 72 patients with pilonidal disease was conducted in order to examine current methods of treatment and establish certain guiding principles for success. The criteria for diagnosis included a pit of variable depth lined by epithelium or granulation tissue containing hair or from which hair had been extracted. A study of these patients suggested the possibility of a dual etiology for pilonidal disease, either congenital or acquired, acting singly or in combination. Management will be influenced by the surgeon's concept of origin in each case. These 72 patients who underwent a total of 116 operations were divided into two groups: (1) unifected sinuses and cysts, (2) infected and recurring cysts. The results of various operative procedures in both these groups indicate a higher probability of success when wide excision and open healing is employed.

Changes in the DNA content of adrenal medulla nuclei of rats intermittently exposed to cold.

In the adrenal medulla of rats exposed intermittently to cold (+4 degrees C) for 100 and 300 hours, a considerable decrease (24 to 40 per cent) of the DNA content per nucleus was observed, followed by restoration to normal or above normal values within 10 days after the withdrawal of the stimulus. The findings were obtained with a scanning integrating histophotometer, and confirmed by microinterferometric investigations (on the basis of the measurement of total dry mass of nuclei isolated in aqueous medium before and after treatment with DNase) and by microchemical determinations, combined with the count of the nuclei in the homogenates. The observed decrease of DNA content cannot be attributed to errors of the methods used, nor to consequences of cellular degeneration. The available evidence seems to indicate a real decrease rather than a change in the state of a part of DNA in the nucleus in vivo whereby it becomes extractable by aqueous solutions. The restoration cannot be due to mitotic processes, which were actually never detected even with the use of colchicine, since the adrenal medulla cells in the adult rat are known to be irreversible, postmitotic cells. A correlation between the functional activity of the adrenal medulla cells and the content or state of DNA in their nuclei is demonstrated.

Microcylinders within mitochondrial cristae in the rat pinealocyte.

A minute cylindrical structure with a dense core, designated as "microcylinder," has been observed within enlarged spaces of mitochondrial cristae in pinealocytes of some adult rats (osmium tetroxide fixed, methacrylate embedded). The microcylinders are 270 to 330 A in diameter and of indeterminate length. Their wall is found to be made up of slender filamentous subunits, probably 6 in number, and surrounds a central filament. The microcylinders are arranged parallel to one another, forming monolayered or, more frequently, multilayered aggregates. Their number within a crista varies considerably. Packets of microcylinders may be seen located in the outer mitochondrial chamber, but are never found in the mitochondrial matrix. They have been observed neither in other cell types of the pineal gland nor in neurons, ependymal, and glial cells of the nearby epithalamic tissue. The origin and nature of the microcylinders are unknown. Glycogen-like particles have been encountered, though very infrequently, accompanying bundles of microcylinders within mitochondrial cristae.

A study of phagocytosis in the ameba Chaos chaos.

The process of phagocytosis was investigated by observing the interactions between the ameba Chaos chaos and its prey (Paramecium aurelia), by studying food cup formation in the living cell, and by studying the fine structure of the newly formed cup using electron microscopy of serial sections. The cytoplasm surrounding the food cup was found to contain structures not seen elsewhere in the ameba. The results are discussed in relation to the mechanisms which operate during food cup formation.

The fine structure and function of the tentacle in Tokophrya infusionum.

The feeding apparatus of Suctoria consists of long, thin, stiff tubes called tentacles. When a swimming prey attaches to the tip of the tentacle a number of events follow in rapid succession. The tentacle broadens, a stream of tiny granules starts to move upward at its periphery to the tip, the prey becomes immobilized and shortly thereafter the cytoplasm of the still living prey begins to flow through the center of the tentacle to the body of the predator. An electron microscope study of the tentacle in Tokophrya infusionum, a protozoan of the subclass Suctoria, has disclosed a number of structural details which help to clarify some of the mechanisms involved in this unusual way of feeding. Each tentacle is composed of two concentric tubes. The lumen of the inner tube is surrounded by 49 tubular fibrils most probably of contractile nature. In the inner tube the cytoplasm of the prey is present during feeding, and in the outer tube are small dense bodies. It was found that the dense bodies originate in the cytoplasm of Tokophrya. They have an elongate, missile-like appearance, pointed at one end, rounded at the other, and are composed of several distinct segments. At the tip of the tentacle they penetrate the plasma membrane, with their pointed ends sticking out. It is assumed that the missile-like bodies play a major role in the feeding process. Their composite structure suggests that they might contain a number of enzymes which most probably are responsible for the various events preceding the actual food intake.

Studies on the release of lysosomal enzymes from kidney lysosomes.

Incubation of kidney lysosomes at 37 degrees results in a graded release of lysosomal enzymes. The release of enzyme occurs in two stages. First the enzymes become available to the substrate but remain sedimentable. Later the amount of soluble enzyme increases and eventually is almost equal to that of the available enzyme. Morphological studies of lysosomes showed that during the process involving increasing availability of enzymes, the lysosomes remained intact. Release of the soluble enzymes was characterized ultrastructurally by a complete loss of the electron-opaque matrix contained within the lysosomal membrane. The increased release of soluble enzymes was concomitant with an increase in the number of individual lysosomes showing complete loss of contents, rather than a gradual loss or dilution of matrix density. Lysosomes which had lost their electron-opaque contents retained their outer membrane intact and were seen to contain numerous internal membranes and small vesicles.

Electron microscope studies on enzyme activity and the isolation of thiohydantoin-induced myelin figures in rat liver.

Characteristic cytoplasmic inclusions (myelin figures), consisting of concentric multilaminar paired membranes surrounding one or more lipid bodies, were produced in rat liver parenchymal cells by incorporating high doses of an anticonvulsant agent (Bax 422Z) into the animals' diet. Enzymatic reaction product (presumably lead phosphate) was found around the central fat of these myelin figures in liver which had been fixed in glutaraldehyde, incubated in Wachstein and Meisel's medium containing adenosine triphosphate or inosine tri- or diphosphate, postosmicated, embedded in epoxy resin, and examined in the electron microscope. In an attempt to isolate myelin figures, fresh liver from medicated rats was homogenized and differentially centrifuged. Thin sections of osmium tetroxide-fixed, Epon-embedded pellets from each fraction were examined with the electron microscope. The concentric membranous whorls, which are probably derived from cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum, broke up as the cells were disrupted and became inextricably mixed with the microsomal fraction. However, when liver previously fixed in formalin for 24 hours was homogenized, the myelin figures remained intact.

Ultrastructural organization of obliquely striated muscle fibers in Ascaris lumbricoides.

The somatic musculature of the nematode, Ascaris, is currently thought to consist of smooth muscle fibers, which contain intracellular supporting fibrils arranged in a regular pattern. Electron microscopic examination shows that the muscle fibers are, in fact, comparable to the striated muscles of vertebrates in that they contain interdigitating arrays of thick and thin myofilaments which form H, A, and I bands. In the A bands each thick filament is surrounded by about 10 to 12 thin filaments. The earlier confusion about the classification of this muscle probably arose from the fact that in one longitudinal plane the myofilaments are markedly staggered and, as a result, the striations in that plane of section are not transverse but oblique, forming an angle of only about 6 degrees with the filament axis. The apparent direction of the striations changes with the plane of the section and may vary all the way from radial to longitudinal. A three-dimensional model is proposed which accounts for the appearance of this muscle in various planes. Z lines as such are absent but are replaced by smaller, less orderly, counterpart "Z bundles" to which thin filaments attach. These bundles are closely associated with fibrillar dense bodies and with deep infoldings of the plasma membrane. The invaginations of the plasma membrane together with intracellular, flattened, membranous cisternae form dyads and triads. It is suggested that these complexes, which also occur at the cell surface, may constitute strategically located, low-impedance patches through which local currents are channeled selectively.

The timing of deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis in the cell cycle of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Randomly dividing cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were briefly exposed to radioactive adenine and then treated successively with dilute acid, ribonuclease, buffered formaldehyde, and NaOH. This treatment was shown to remove virtually all the radioactivity of the labelled cells other than that in DNA. Thus, in subsequent autoradiographs, only cells which had been synthesizing DNA during exposure to the precursor were labelled. The ages of these individuals within the cell cycle were estimated by measuring their sizes. This revealed that incorporation into DNA occurred almost exclusively during the first quarter of the cell cycle, starting with the initial appearance of the bud. This behaviour agreed closely with that of cells growing in artificially synchronized cultures.

Cytological and cytochemical studies of green monkey kidney cells infected in vitro with simian virus 40.

Cytological and cytochemical studies of green monkey kidney cells infected with SV40 virus indicated that the type of lesion produced was influenced by the multiplicity of infection and that the lesions appeared later and progressed more slowly when the inoculum was diluted. The earliest change consisted of enlargement of ribonucleoprotein-containing spherules in the nucleolus (nucleolini). This was followed by rarefaction, with or without condensation, of the chromatin and the appearance of one or more homogeneous masses of inclusion material containing DNA, RNA, and non-histone protein which eventually filled the nucleus. In some instances the chromatin appeared to be directly transformed into inclusion material. In the later stages of infection, the ribonucleoprotein of the nucleolini was no longer stainable and material resembling the nucleoprotein of the intranuclear inclusions was found in the nucleolar vacuoles and in the cytoplasm. The nucleic acids in the inclusions were stained by toluidine blue, toluidine blue-molybdate, the Feulgen stain, and by methyl green. The stainable material was extractable by nuclease digestion or by hot trichloroacetic acid. Green or yellowish green staining by acridine orange was apparently due to binding of dye by protein and not by nucleic acids since the staining reaction was not reduced by extraction of nucleic acids by hot trichloroacetic acid. Extraction with pepsin in combination with ribonuclease or deoxyribonuclease removed practically all the inclusions from the cells; consequently they could not be stained with acridine orange. The cytochemical studies suggest that the use of pepsin together with nuclease is not a meaningful technique.

Extrusion of nucleoli from pronuclei of the rat.

Electron microscope observations of osmium tetroxide-fixed rat eggs indicate that small nucleoli are extruded from pronuclei in a sharply demarcated time period after sperm penetration. Approximately 4(1/2) hours after sperm penetration, fine fibrous material aggregated in distinct loci along the inner surface of the nuclear envelope and condensed into small, dense bodies. The term tertiary nucleolus or extrusion body is used to designate the forming bodies. The small tertiary nucleoli form distinct protrusions from the pronuclei during the following developmental period and finally bud off into the cytoplasm, carrying with them a small portion of the double nuclear envelope. The extrusion bodies can be observed only in the vicinity of the pronuclei and have not been seen near the cell membrane. The fate of the tertiary nucleoli is not known; apparently they transform or disappear after they have passed into the cytoplasm. Eleven hours after sperm penetration, tertiary nucleoli are not present near the nuclear membrane and the extrusion activity has apparently ceased. Large and small nucleoli react similarly to cytochemical reagents: they are Feulgen negative; they are positive to the Millon, Sakaguchi, brom-phenol blue, and PAS reactions. Azure B stain combined with nuclease extraction indicates the presence of small amounts of RNA in the nucleoli.

The fine structure of Brunner's glands in the mouse.

Examined with the electron microscope, the secretory cells of the submucosal glands of Brunner in the mouse present a curious combination of the fine-structural features of both serous and mucus-secreting cells. The cells have numerous mitochondria, abundant basal ergastoplasm, dense secretory granules that bear a superficial resemblance to pancreatic zymogen granules, and an unusually extensive Golgi apparatus. The prominence of the lamellar, vesicular, and vacuolar elements of the Golgi complex facilitates detailed observation of these components. More evident than in other glandular cells, aggregates of small vesicles appear to represent the transitional elements and are vehicles for transport of the product between the ergastoplasm and the Golgi complex. The numerous vesicular evaginations of smooth-surfaced regions on cisternae of the rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum and accumulations of innumerable vesicles of similar size in the area between the nearest profiles of the ergastoplasm and the Golgi complex support this contention. The cytological characteristics and physiologic properties of Brunner's glands in various species are discussed briefly. It is concluded that the submucosal glands of the mouse are excellent material for exploration of the ultrastructural correlates of both protein and carbohydrate secretion, and it is suggested that their secretion may have functions other than those generally attributed to them, namely, chemical and mechanical protection of the duodenal surface epithelium.

Differentiation and proliferation of embryonic mast cells of the rat.

Histochemical reactions and radioautography were used to investigate the sequence of mast cell development in rat embryos. Mast cells arise ubiquitously in and are confined to the loose connective tissue in the embryo. The alcian blue-safranin reaction distinguishes between weakly sulfated and strongly sulfated mucopolysaccharides by a shift from alcian blue to safranin staining. Based on this reaction and morphologic characteristics, four stages were identified. Stage I mast cells are lymphocyte-like cells with cytoplasmic granules which invariably stain blue with the alcian blue-safranin reaction. In Stage II cells the majority of granules are alcian blue-positive, but some safranin-positive granules have appeared. Stage III mast cells are distinguished by a majority of safranin-positive cytoplasmic granules; some alcian blue-positive granules still remain. Stage IV cells contain only safranin-positive granules. Thymidine-H(3) uptake and identification of mitotic figures indicates that mast cells in Stages I and II comprise a mitotic pool while those in Stages III and IV are mitotically inactive. The pattern of S(35)O(4) incorporation and the sequence of appearance of histochemically identifiable mast cell constituents corroborates division of the proliferation and differentiation of embryonic mast cells into the four stages described above. The process of formation of mast cell granules is interpreted as reflecting the synthesis and accumulation of a heparin precursor in alcian blue positive granules followed by the synthesis and accumulation of highly N-sulfated heparin along with mast cell chymase and finally histamine in safranin-positive granules.

Changes in fine structure and acid phosphatase localization in rat thyroid cells following thyrotropin administration.

Shortly after the administration of 1/40 unit thyrotropin to rats, 24 hours post-hypophysectomy, the following sequence of changes has been observed within thyroid follicular epithelial cells: (1) the appearance of apical cell surface activity consisting of pseudopods projecting into the follicular lumen; (2) apparent phagocytic engulfment of colloid droplets lacking indications of acid phosphatase activity; (3) close association and probable fusion of newly formed colloid droplets and dense granules, the latter cytochemically positive for acid phosphatase activity; (4) the appearance of presumptive acid phosphatase activity within colloid droplets; and, (5) further colloid droplet changes, viz., basipetal migration and decrease in size, accompanied by an increase in density and in demonstrable acid phosphatase activity. These changes appeared to represent the resorption and degradation of follicular colloid. Comparable results were obtained using intact and more heavily stimulated animals. Colloid biosynthesis was tentatively visualized in these cells as a separate mechanism involving small vesicles prominent in the Golgi region and beneath the apical plasma membrane of some, but not all, thyroid follicular cells in each specimen.

Incorporation of H3-thymidine into chloroplast DNA of marine algae.

The chloroplasts of three genera of marine algae, Dictyota, Padina, and Bryopsis, were labeled with tritiated-thymidine for various time periods during culture in "Erd-Schreiber's" solution. Autoradiographs were prepared from both smeared and sectioned material. They revealed that almost all of the radioactivity was in the cytoplasm and associated with the chloroplasts, as detected in the overlying silver halide crystals. Deoxyribonuclease, ribonuclease, and hot trichloracetic acid treatments indicated that the loss of radioactivity corresponded to the removal of DNA and not RNA. Quantitative studies of silver grain distribution suggested that the radioactivity of the labeled DNA originated from the edge of the pyrenoids on either side in the longitudinal direction of Bryopsis chloroplasts. Nuclei did not incorporate H(3)-thymidine even though cells were dividing rapidly in the three genera examined. It is postulated that the enzyme, thymidine kinase, is absent as a coding sequence of nuclear DNA in algae, but is present in chloroplast DNA. When the chloroplasts of Dictyota and Padina in various stages of division were scored for labeling, there appeared to be a DNA synthesis period, analogous to S period in cell division. This chloroplast-labeling period occurred just previous to fission. Many of the criteria seem to have been satisfied to establish the self-reproducing and semi-autonomous nature of chloroplasts, especially when combined with the chemical, genetic, and morphological evidence.

Phenobarbital-induced synthesis of the microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme system and its relationship to the proliferation of endoplasmic membranes. A morphological and biochemical study.

Liver microsomes, isolated from rats which had been treated with phenobarbital in vivo, were found to exhibit increased activities of oxidative demethylation and TPNH-cytochrome c reductase and an increased amount of CO-binding pigment. Simultaneous administration of actinomycin D or puromycin abolished the phenobarbital-induced enzyme synthesis. Increased rate of P(i) (32) incorporation into microsomal phospholipid was the first sign of phenobarbital stimulation and appeared 3 hours after a single injection of this drug. Microsomes were divided into smooth-surfaced and rough-surfaced vesicle fractions. The fraction consisting of smooth-surfaced vesicles exhibited the greatest increase in protein content and oxidative demethylation activity after phenobarbital administration in vivo. Ultrastructural studies revealed that drug treatment also gave rise to proliferation of the endoplasmic reticulum in the hepatic parenchymal cells, first noticed after two phenobarbital injections. The phenobarbital-induced synthesis of the metabolizing enzymes is discussed with special reference to the relationship to the stimulated synthesis of the endoplasmic membranes.

Immunologic relations among various animal collagens.

By the use of complement fixation and in vivo immunofluorescence with cross-absorption studies it was shown that acid soluble collagens prepared from rat, mouse, guinea pig, chicken, carp, and man exhibit species specificity. Rat and mouse collagens were found to be indistinguishable and to cross-react with guinea pig collagen. Cross-reactions also occurred between the collagens of rat and man and chicken and man. Tissue specificity, or an antigen common to all of the collagens, was not demonstrated. There was complete agreement in the results of the two immunologic methods. The findings in this study support the conclusion that collagen in some form is present in the renal glomerular basement membranes.

The in vitro differentiation of mononuclear phagocytes. 3. The reversibility of granule and hydrolytic enzyme formation and the turnover of granule constituents.

Mouse mononuclear phagocytes cultivated in 50 per cent newborn calf serum medium pinocytize actively and form large numbers of phase-dense granules as well as three hydrolytic enzymes. When such cells are then placed in 1 per cent newborn calf serum they illustrate (a) a low level of pinocytic activity, (b) a shrinkage in granule size, and (c) a loss in cell protein, acid phosphatase, beta-glucuronidase, and cathepsin. Examination of the extracellular medium revealed no detectable hydrolase activity. The reintroduction of cells into high levels of serum again resulted in granule and enzyme formation. Cells rapidly incorporated fluorescein-conjugated calf serum proteins into the phase-dense granules. The fluorescence of labeled granules was lost during an 18 hour period in non-fluorescein-containing medium. Crystalline egg white lysozyme was concentrated in the macrophages. Approximately 80 per cent of the cell-associated enzyme was lost during a 24 hour washout period in either 1 or 50 per cent serum medium. No enzymatic activity could be recovered in the medium. Colloidal gold was taken up and concentrated in macrophage granules. Quantitative assays revealed this particle to be conserved during a 24 hour washout period.

Specific carcinoembryonic antigens of the human digestive system.

A wide variety of human adult and fetal tissues were studied by immune-diffusion techniques in agar gel to determine whether they contained the tumor-specific antigen(s) previously found in coionic cancers. In the adult tissues it was demonstrated that identical antigens were present in all tested specimens of malignant tumors of the entodermally derived epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas, but were absent from all other tested adult tissues. The common antigenic constituents, therefore, represent system-specific cancer antigens of the human digestive system. System-specific cancer antigens have not previously been demonstrated in humans. Experiments with fetal tissues demonstrated that identical antigens were also present in fetal gut, liver, and pancreas between 2 and 6 months of gestation. These components were named "carcinoembryonic" antigens of the human digestive system. On the basis of the present findings and the recent work regarding control of the expression of genetic potentialities in various types of cells, it was concluded that the carcinoembryonic antigens represent cellular constituents which are repressed during the course of differentiation of the normal digestive system epithelium and reappear in the corresponding malignant cells by a process of derepressive-dedifferentiation.

Humoral and cellular aspects of the immune response to the somatic antigen of Salmonella enteritidis.

A study was made of the cellular and humoral aspects of the immune response of the rabbit to the somatic polysaccharide of Salmonella enteritidis. The response to a single intravenous injection was characterized by the appearance of elevated titers of bactericidal antibody between 2 and 3 days later. The maximum titer was dose-dependent and occurred between 5 and 7 days, thereafter declining rapidly during the first month. The significant stabilized levels which then persisted for at least 1 year were also dose-dependent. Most of the antibody produced (>99 per cent) was associated with the macroglobulin fraction of serum. Plaque-forming cells (PFC) elaborating antibody specific for this somatic antigen were detected and enumerated by the technique of localized hemolysis in gel employing polysaccharide-coated sheep erythrocytes. Significant numbers of PFC were encountered in the spleen as early as 14 to 18 hours after a single intravenous injection of antigen; after 36 hours the number of PFC rose rapidly and culminated in a maximum population at 5 days, followed by a rapid decline and plateau similar to that for circulating antibody. The spleen was the principal organ involved in the systemic response, but other lymphoid tissues including bone marrow, peripheral blood leucocytes, and thymus contributed significantly. After an interval of 3 months the effect on humoral antibody titers of a second injection of antigen was dependent on the amount of polysaccharide administered; markedly greater titers were now obtained with 0.02 to 0.002 microg, whereas 0.2 to 20 microg resulted in a duplication of the initial humoral response. The cellular response to a second dose of 5 microg was accelerated; larger numbers of PFC appeared more rapidly, attained a maximum population by day 3, and exceeded the primary response by a factor of two. This acceleration in the attainment of maximum numbers of PFC and the increased bactericidal antibody titers following a second injection of limiting amounts of antigen suggest that these somatic polysaccharides may in fact evoke a "secondary" type of response in the rabbit.

Immunochemical study of antigenic specificity in delayed hypersensitivity. IV. The production of unresponsiveness to delayed hypersensitivity with a single antigenic determinant.

Injections of various conjugates of arsanilic acid into newborn guinea pigs produced a specific tolerance in respect to subsequent development of hapten-specific delayed hypersensitivity. In general, larger polyvalent conjugates produced longer lasting and more profound suppression of delayed sensitivity than did the smaller ones. Carrier injections alone were ineffective. At lower doses of conjugate, breakthrough of tolerance occurred first with animals immunized with the heterologous carrier conjugate. The duration of tolerance produced by injection of monovalent conjugates into neonates is in contrast to the transient inhibition produced by the same conjugates in previously sensitized animals, suggesting that different target cells may be involved in these two phenomena.

Genetic control of the antibody response. I. Demonstration of determinant-specific differences in response to synthetic polypeptide antigens in two strains of inbred mice.

Immunization of CBA and C57 mice with a branched, multichain synthetic polypeptide, poly (tyr,glu)-poly DL-ala--poly lys, ((T,G)-A--L), in Freund's complete adjuvant results in a tenfold or more difference in the antigen-binding capacity of sera from the two strains, although they respond equally to bovine serum albumin. Immunization of CBA x C57 F(1), F(1) x CBA, and F(1) x C57 mice reveals definite genetic control of the response to (T,G)-A--L, which appears to be due to a single major genetic factor, with perhaps one or more modifying factors. Immunization of CBA and C57 mice with (H,G)-A--L, a synthetic polypeptide in which histidine replaces tyrosine, gives the opposite result, CBA's respond and C57's do not. From this, it appears that the genetic control of the response to (T,G)-A--L is specific for the antigenic determinant. The implications of these results are discussed.

Effects of chronic excess salt ingestion. Further demonstration that genetic factors influence the development of hypertension: evidence from experimental hypertension due to cortisone and to adrenal regeneration.

Two strains of selectively inbred rats were demonstrated previously to have opposite genetic predisposition to develop hypertension from NaCl ingestion (1, 2), DOCA-NaCl (3), and unilateral renal artery compression without NaCl (3). Using these same strains, similar disparate responses were elicited with two other models for inducing experimental hypertension, namely cortisone and adrenal regeneration. On the basis of these experiences, it is proposed that the genetic substrate will be found to modify significantly the influence of all non-genetic factors considered to play a primary role in the etiology of experimental hypertension. Furthermore, it is suggested that similar genetic and non-genetic factors interact to produce hypertension in man. An hypothesis has been elaborated that is compatible with the experimental data and there is some clinical evidence to support this hypothesis.

Studies on metabolism of vitamin A. Absorption of retinal (vitamin A aldehyde) in rats.

1. Young rats with low reserves of vitamin A were dosed with retinal in groundnut oil, and the stomach, the contents, mucosa and muscles of small intestine, the blood and the liver were analysed at periods up to 24hr. after dosing. 2. Up to 6hr. after the dose, retinal was present in high concentrations in the contents, mucosa and muscles of the intestine. Small but significant amounts were present in blood and liver at all times. 3. The intestinal mucosa and muscles always contained small amounts of retinol and its esters. 4. A study of the distribution of the three forms of the vitamin within the mucosal cell showed that most of the mucosal retinal enters the cell unchanged. 5. When protein-depleted rats were similarly given retinal, the rate of reduction of the aldehyde, and the consequent deposition in the liver of retinol and its esters, progressively decreased with reduced protein intake.

The metabolism of glucose by the rabbit lens in the presence and absence of oxygen.

1. The effect of the absence of oxygen on the metabolism of [U-(14)C]glucose by the rabbit lens has been examined. 2. Protein-free extracts of incubated lens were subjected to electrophoresis followed by chromatography on paper; radioautographs showed 10 compounds substantially labelled. In the absence of oxygen, less radioactivity appeared in glucose, sorbitol, fructose, alanine, glutamic acid, glutathione and nucleotides, and more in lactic acid, alpha-glycerophosphate and glycerol. 3. The radioactivity of lens protein was about two to four times greater after aerobic than after anaerobic incubation. 4. The radioactivity of carbon dioxide was 2- to 4-fold greater after aerobic incubation than after anaerobic incubation. 5. After aerobic incubation of the lens, the radioactivity of all the labelled compounds was higher in the outer part (cortex) than in the inner part (nucleus). 6. Free glycerol has been found to be present in the lens. Its concentration, and that of alpha-glycerophosphate, has been measured in the lens of several species of animal.

The metabolism of gamma-2,3,4,5,6-pentachlorocyclohex-1-ene and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane in rats.

1. After intraperitoneal administration, gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (Gammexane) and gamma-2,3,4,5,6-pentachlorocyclohex-1-ene were converted by rats into 2,3,5- and 2,4,5-trichlorophenol, which were excreted as free phenols and as sulphuric acid and glucuronic acid conjugates. 2. Derivatives of 2,4,5-trichlorophenol and 2,4,5-trichlorophenyl glucosiduronic acid and 2,4-dichlorophenylmercapturic acid were isolated from the urine as metabolites of gamma-2,3,4,5,6-pentachlorocyclohex-1-ene. 3. The phenolic metabolites of gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane and gamma-2,3,4,5,6-pentachlorocyclohex-1-ene isolated from urine were similar to those of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, which indicates that the two latter compounds are intermediates in gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane metabolism in rats.

The isolation and properties of epithelial-cell "ghosts" from rat small intestine.

1. The preparation of gram quantities of isolated epithelial-cell ;ghosts' from mucosal scrapings of rat small intestine is described. The method involves dispersing the tissue by gentle homogenization in 6% dextran in Krebs-Ringer phosphate, pH7.4, followed by filtration through nylon cloth and sedimentation by low-speed centrifuging. 2. The isolated epithelial-cell ;ghosts' contained all of the DNA, but only 52% of the protein and 53-57% of the RNA of the original homogenate. They contained most of the activity of the following enzymes found in the homogenate: aminopeptidase (71%); alkaline beta-glycerophosphatase (82%); invertase (92%); adenosine triphosphatase (93-116%); acid beta-glycerophosphatase (83%); nonspecific esterase (76%); succinate dehydrogenase (96%). Only small proportions of the total lactate-dehydrogenase (10%) and phosphoglucose-isomerase (2%) activities found in the homogenate were recovered in the isolated cell ;ghosts'. 3. The epithelial-cell ;ghost' preparation did not respire unless cofactors and substrates were added, and did not consume glucose or produce lactic acid from glucose. 4. The effect of varying the composition of the homogenization medium was studied. Concentrations of dextran (mol.wt. 15x10(4)) from 1 to 12%, solutions of dextrans (all at 6%) with mol.wt. varying between 3.6x10(4) and 2x10(6), and a solution of 8% polyethylene glycol (mol.wt. 4000) served equally well for the production of epithelial-cell ;ghosts'. Two of these solutions, however, 12% dextran (mol.wt.15x10(4)) and 6% dextran (mol.wt. 2x10(6)), were too viscous to allow the complete sedimentation of the cell ;ghosts' at low relative centrifugal forces. Omission of either Krebs-Ringer phosphate or dextran from the medium resulted in almost complete cell breakage during the homogenization. 5. The isolated cell ;ghosts' were used as a starting material for subcellular fractionation of rat intestinal mucosa by differential centrifugation. The distributions of protein and succinate-dehydrogenase activity among the fractions were compared with corresponding values in fractions isolated by differential centrifugation of mucosa homogenized in 0.3m-sucrose-5mm-EDTA, pH7.4. The method in which cell ;ghosts' were used as starting material gave a better separation and cleaner fractions than the method in which untreated mucosal scrapings were used.

Degradation of Wood Preservatives by Fungi.

Wood-inhabiting fungi, not necessarily responsible for major decay, are shown to be capable of degrading a toxic compound into a less potent form, thus rendering it less effective in protecting wood from decay by less-tolerant basidiomycetous wood-destroyers. Sweetgum or pine sapwood blocks treated with preservatives (ammoniacal copper arsenate, fluor-chrome-arsenate-dinitrophenol, a creosote or pentachlorophenol) were exposed progressively to two different wood-inhabiting fungi with sterilization between the first and second exposure. The fungus in the first exposure was usually an Ascomycete or a Fungi Imperfecti-Chaetomium globosum, Phoma, Orbicula, Graphium, Pestalozzia, or Trichoderma species, isolated from wood below the ground. In one experiment, the fungus in the first exposure was a basidiomycete, Lenzites trabea or Polyporus versicolor. The second fungus, a prominent Basidiomycete-Coniophora puteana, Lentinus lepideus, or Lenzites trabea-was the bioassay fungus, since its purpose was to show whether the first fungus had degraded the preservative. Generally, the treated block, except where exposed to another fungus, remained virtually untouched by the bioassay fungus. Clearly, therefore, the first fungus had rendered the preservative ineffective but without appreciably decaying the wood itself Chemical analyses of treated blocks indicated that in the first exposure the fungi had substantially depleted sodium arsenate and pentachlorophenol.

Selection of a Microbiological Corrosion System for Studying Effects on Structural Aluminum Alloys.

Two laboratory methods, a metal-strip test and a tank test, were evaluated as microbiological corrosion systems for producing corroded test specimens on a structural aluminum alloy. The results show that corrosion of the test alloy occurred best in the metal-strip test in a deionized water-fuel medium inoculated with a mixture of microorganisms under aerated conditions. The metal-strip test was more successful for producing large numbers of corroded test specimens and proved more economical than the tank-type test, since less structural material is needed to obtain a specimen with sufficient corrosion areas, and since the corrosion can more easily be restricted by maskants to certain areas for specific test purposes.

Gelatinase Activity by Marine Fungi.

Gelatinase activity was detectable in the culture filtrates of 13 of 14 species of marine fungi tested. The fungi were grown under conditions of submerged culture in a medium consisting of corn meal, soybean meal, and CaCO(3). The degree of enzymatic activity did not necessarily correlate with the amino nitrogen content of the filtrates. Eight of the filtrates contained measurable quantities of glutamic acid and alanine. Highest levels of gelatinase were obtained in the culture filtrates of Halosphaeria mediosetigera. Increasing the corn meal concentration of the medium resulted in even greater production of gelatinase by H. mediosetigera, whereas amino acid yields were enhanced by higher concentrations of soybean meal. Supplementation of the high corn meal medium with either a mineral mixture or distillers' solubles brought about a faster rate of production of gelatinase and, in the case of the distillers' solubles, a significantly higher level of enzyme, as well.

beta-Glucosidase Activity in Phytopathogenic Bacteria.

Most of 58 isolates of phytopathogenic and related bacteria comprising 24 species in the genera Agrobacterium, Erwinia, Corynebacterium, Pseudomonas, and Xanthomonas exhibited beta-glucosidase activity, especially the gall-nonforming pathogenic pseudomonads and soft rot organisms. The gall-forming pseudomonads and P. fluorescens exhibited no beta-glucosidase activity, with the exception of one isolate of P. savastanoi which showed slight activity on an inorganic nitrogen-arbutin medium. The best medium for demonstrating beta-glucosidase activity contained peptone as the nitrogen source and arbutin. beta-Glucosidase activity in this medium was indicated by either acid production or browning. P. syringae, in contrast to other bacteria tested, produced most beta-glucosidase in a medium containing large amounts of glucose. Chromatographic analyses confirmed that splitting of the glucoside occurred at the glucosidic linkage. Reaction of sonically treated bacterial cells with indican or p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucoside proved a rapid method for assaying relative amounts of beta-glucosidase among bacterial species. Harda's paper-strip method of detecting beta-glucosidase also was useful in revealing the distribution and relative amounts of beta-glucosidase in most bacteria, but did not indicate the relatively greater amount of beta-glucosidase in P. syringae.

Antibiotics Against Plant Disease: VIII. Screening for Nonpolyenic Antifungal Antibiotics Produced by Streptomycetes.

In a survey of Streptomyces species, methods were designed and followed that would specifically select strains capable of producing heat-stable, nonpolyenic, antifungal antibiotics. Of 500 strains grown in shaken flasks, 240 of the culture liquors contained active factors as demonstrated by paper-disc assay against Mucor ramannianus. Culture filtrates and mycelial extracts of the active strains were examined by ultraviolet spectrophotometry; 166 were nonpolyenic as determined by absorption spectra. Heat-stability tests of the nonpolyenic antibiotics over a broad pH range revealed that 15 were stable under all test conditions, 70 moderately stable, and 81 unstable. Culture liquors containing stable, nonpolyenic antifungal agents were chromatographed with eight solvent systems in an attempt to identify the antibiotics. The producing cultures were studied by cross-antagonism tests to discover similarities with producers of known antibacterial antibiotics. Two of the antibiotics produced by promising strains were identified as cycloheximide and musarin. Six antibiotics, presumably new, were detected.

Lipid Alterations During the Fermentation of Dill Pickles.

Analyses of various lipid fractions of sections of cucumbers and of good and bloated dill pickles showed that marked changes occur in all lipid fractions during fermentation. The most striking difference noted was the decrease in the phospholipid fraction. A nearly fourfold increase in free fatty acid, as well as a marked increase in the neutral fat fatty acids and unsaponifiables, occurred. Gas chromatographic analyses of the methyl esters of fatty acids from the various lipid fractions yielded further interesting data. From the analyses, 41 esters were identified; however, 16 of the esters accounted for at least 95% of the acids. Among the marked changes were the increases in linoleic and linolenic acids in good pickles, in contrast to the increase in oleic acid in the bloated pickles. The presence of tridecenoic acid in cucumbers, and its absence in pickles; and the absence of caproic, caprylic, and capric acids in cucumbers, and its presence in pickles, were interesting. The data demonstrated that the lipid alterations that occur during fermentation of cucumbers are analogous to those previously reported for the sauerkraut fermentation.

Pure Culture Fermentation of Brined Cucumbers.

The relative abilities of Pediococcus cerevisiae, Lactobacillus plantarum, L. brevis, and several other species of lactic acid bacteria to grow and produce acid in brined cucumbers were evaluated in pure culture fermentations. Such fermentations were made possibly by the use of two techniques, gamma radiation (0.83 to 1.00 Mrad) and hot-water blanching (66 to 80 C for 5 min), designed first to rid the cucumbers of naturally occurring, interfering, and competitive microbial groups prior to brining, followed by inoculation with the desired lactic acid bacteria. Of the nine species tested, strains of the three common to cucumber fermentations, P. cerevisiae, L. plantarum, and L. brevis, grew to the highest populations, and produced the highest levels of brine acidity and the lowest pH values in fermentations at 5.4 to 5.6% NaCl by weight; also, their sequence of active development in fermentations, with the use of a three-species mixture for inoculation, was in the species order just named. This sequence of occurrence was similar to that estimated by others for natural fermentations. The rates of growth and acid production in fermentations with a mixture of P. cerevisiae, L. plantarum, and L. brevis increased as the incubation temperature was increased from 21 to 27 to 32 C; however, the maximal populations and acidities attained were essentially the same for fermentations at each temperature. Further, these same three species were found to be the most salt tolerant of those tested; their upper limit for appreciable growth and measurable acid production was about 8% salt, whereas thermophilic species such as L. thermophilus, L. lactis, L. helveticus, L. fermenti, and L. delbrueckii exhibited a much lower salt tolerance, ranging from about 2.5 to 4.0%. However, certain strains of L. delbrueckii grew very rapidly in cucumbers brined at 2.5 to 3.0% salt, and produced sufficient acid in about 30 hr at 48 C to reduce the brine pH from above 7.0 to below 4.0. An inexpensive, pure culture fermentor which was suitable for gamma radiation, resistant to salt and acid, and which permitted repeated aseptic sampling of the fermenting brine, is illustrated and the specifications are given.

EPITHELIAL CELL PENETRATION AS AN ESSENTIAL STEP IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF BACILLARY DYSENTERY.

LaBrec, Eugene H., Herman Schneider, Thomas J. Magnani, and Samuel B. Formal. Epithelial cell penetration as an essential step in the pathogenesis of bacillary dysentery. J. Bacteriol. 88:1503-1518. 1964.-A parent strain of Shigella flexneri 2a and a colonial mutant derived from it were studied in three animal models. Both strains were equally virulent for mice when living cells suspended in hog gastric mucin were injected by the intraperitoneal route. Feeding the parent strain to starved guinea pigs, followed by the intraperitoneal injection of opium, resulted in the formation of ulcerative lesions in the intestinal tract and in the death of these animals. When the colonial variant was fed to similarly prepared animals, the animals survived and the intestinal tract remained normal. The parent produced diarrheal symptoms and intestinal lesions after its oral administration to rhesus monkeys; the variant caused neither symptoms nor pathology in this species. Studies were carried out to define the characteristics present in the parent strain and absent in the colonial mutant, which would enable the parent to produce ulcerative lesions of the bowel and death in the guinea pig model or intestinal lesions and diarrheal symptoms in the monkey. Neither serological studies nor growth studies conducted both in vitro and in vivo offered a clue to explain this difference. The virulent parent strain was shown to penetrate the bowel epithelium and enter the lamina propria; the avirulent mutant did not do this. Entrance to the lamina propria was by way of the epithelial cell of the mucosa. The avirulent mutant did not possess the capacity to penetrate this cell. This observation was extended to show that the virulent parent possesses the ability to infect and multiply within HeLa cells; furthermore, the organisms are able to penetrate epithelial cells of the guinea pig cornea, causing ulcerative lesions. The avirulent variant possesses neither of these capacities. It is suggested that epithelial cell penetration is a major factor in determining the pathogenicity of dysentery bacilli.

Folic acid clearances and basal serum folate levels in patients with thyroid disease.

The plasma clearance of intravenously administered folic acid was abnormally rapid in all of five patients studied with untreated hyperthyroidism; in three, the basal serum L. casei folate level was subnormal. Four of these patients and another patient were studied at various intervals after partial or complete correction of the hyperthyroid state. Partial correction resulted in a continued fast clearance in one patient, a return to borderline-normal values in the second, and a normal clearance in the third. Complete euthyroidism was achieved in two patients; their clearance values had returned to borderline-normal at this time. In two patients studied after partial correction, the serum L. casei folate levels had become normal whereas the clearance values remained abnormally rapid. These findings suggest that hyperthyroidism in man is associated with depletion of folate stores and subclinical deficiency of this vitamin. This is attributed to an increased demand for folic acid in the hypermetabolic state.

Isolation and Identification of a Leptospire of The Hebdomadis Serogroup (L. Hardjo) From Cattle in Canada.

During the summer of 1961 an outbreak of atypical mastitis in a small herd of dairy cattle was investigated. The clinical findings, which included a single abortion, were suggestive of leptospirosis and serological studies indicated that a serotype other than the usual L. pomona was the causative agent. A fastidious leptospire recovered from the urine of one cow has been identified as L. hardjo, a member of the hebdomadis group. The difficulties encountered in isolation, adaptation to standard media and serotyping are described.

Complement-Fixing And Neutralizing Antibody Response To Bovine Viral Diarrhea And Hog Cholera Antigens.

In calves inoculated with bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) viruses and soluble antigen, the complement-fixing (CF) antibodies appeared before serum-neutralizing (SN) antibodies and remained at high levels throughout the test period. A rapid rise in SN antibodies occurred after challenge with homologous virus with no apparent effect on CF antibody levels. The CF antibody responses in calves infected with cytopathogenic NADL-MD and noncytopathogenic CG-1220 viruses were similar whereas SN antibody responses indicated strain specificity by reciprocal cross-neutralization tests. The CF antibody levels in 5 hog cholera (HC) antisera were assayed using the soluble antigen of NADL-MD BVD virus. No demonstrable SN antibodies were present in four HC antisera tested against NADL-MD virus, but a significant titer was present in the commercially prepared antiserum. Virus was reisolated from animals infected with BVD viruses by buffy coat culture technique during 3 weeks postinoculation, even when significant levels of CF and SN antibodies were present.

Production of High Potency Anti-Teschen Disease Serum From Rabbits and Guinea Pigs.

An antiserum of high antibody content against Teschen disease Konratice virus was obtained by inoculating rabbits and guinea pigs with an antigen composed of aluminum gel and virus propagated in swine kidney cell cultures. The rabbit and guinea pig serums neutralized 1,500 TCID(50) of virus at dilutions of 1:5,120 and 1:2,048, respectively. The antibody level in the rabbit serum was tenfold greater than that in convalescent swine serum. Rabbit serum neutralized 2.8 x 10(6) plaque-forming units of the Konratice virus. At a dilution of 1:5,120, this serum neutralized 1,500 TCID(50) of the Reporyje virus. The methods used to prepare and assay the serum are described.

Clinical Chemical Studies in Aleutian Disease of Mink.

Clinical chemical determinations were carried out on blood removed by cardiac puncture from 49 mink affected with Aleutian disease and 25 normal animals and the respective differences tested for statistical significance. Blood urea nitrogen, serum total protein and globulin, thymol turbidity, glutamic oxalacetic and glutamic pyruvic transaminases and amylase were definitely elevated in the affected animals whereas serum calcium, albumin and A/G ratio were depressed. No statistically significant difference was apparent between the two groups in the comparison of inorganic phosphorus, alkaline and acid phosphatases, bilirubin, total cholesterol and esters, cephalin-cholesterol flocculation (3+ in each case), sodium, potassium, chloride, CO(2)-combining power, leucine aminopeptidase and lactic dehydrogenase (means: over 2,000 u./ml.). For both the control and affected mink, the distribution of serum lactic dehydrogenase isozymes resembled that of human homologous serum hepatitis. Electrophoresis of serum proteins confirmed earlier findings of hypergammaglobulinemia in the diseased animals but a fast-moving or pre-albumin component, averaging 4% of the total protein, occurred in both the diseased and normal mink.

Epizootiologic Studies of Shipping Fever of Cattle: I. The Microbial Agents Isolated.

Nineteen strains of Pasteurella spp., but no viruses cytopathogenic for bovine embryonic kidney cells were isolated from pneumonic lesions present in "normal" veal calves at slaughter. In studies on two herds of native cattle and six lots of western feeder calves, Pasteurella spp. were isolated from nasal swabs from healthy cattle and those with shipping fever. Viruses of the psittacosis-lymphogranuloma group were isolated from nasal swabs from animals in five groups. Viruses provisionally identified as bovine enteroviruses were isolated from nasal swabs of calves in two lots. There was serologic evidence of a temporal association of myxovirus para-influenza 3 (PI3) with shipping fever in three lots of calves. From two of these three lots, strains of PI3 were isolated from ten animals, four of which had clinical shipping fever at the time of virus isolation.

Haemolytic Complement Activity of Sera of Foetal and New-Born Lambs.

Determination of the haemolytic complement titres of serum from 24 foetal lambs bled at 77 to 149 days gestation failed to reveal this activity earlier than 123 days. Titres near the end of the gestation period of 150 days were still very low. Among serum specimens collected from 17 newborn lambs before suckling, three were still without demonstrable complement activity. During the first week titres rose considerably in all of these lambs, were higher at three weeks but at ten weeks were still below the adult level.A number of foeti had been injected with antigen mixtures at 50 to 111 days' gestation and had responded with antibody development to one or more of these antigens. The rate of development of complement in these treated foetal lambs appeared similar to that in their untreated twin controls.

Complement Titres of Naturally and Artificially Raised Piglets II. Comparison with the Results of Electrophoretic Examinations.

Serial serum samples from piglets in one naturally-raised and three artificially-raised litters, 19 animals, were examined by cellulose acetate electrophoresis. The electropherograms of all day-old suckling and colostrum deprived piglets showed five definite bands, the first, third, fourth and fifth corresponding in position to the albumin, alpha-, beta- and gamma-globulin regions for adult pig serum. The second, well-defined band was located between the albumin and main alpha-globulin bands. This component, considered to be alpha(1)-globulin or fetuin, was no longer visible as a distinct band in the electrophoretic pattern for sera of three-week old suckling piglets or of five-week old artificially-raised piglets. No consistent relationship was observed between the rate of increase in haemolytic complement titre and the proportional changes in the various categories of serum globulins.

Bat Rabies in Ontario.

Rabies has been diagnosed for the first time in the bat population of Ontario. In the course of a study involving 72 bats from 24 counties of the province, five big brown bats (E. fuscus) were found to be infected with rabies through the mouse inoculation test. At the present time, it does not look as if bats have been connected with the epizootic of sylvatic rabies in Ontario.La rage est apparue pour la première fois chez les chauves-souris en Ontario. Au cours d'une étude qui a porté sur 72 de ces animaux provenant de 24 comtés de la province, l'inoculation d'animaux de laboratoire a permis confirmer la présence de la maladie chez cinq grosses chauves-souris brunes (E. fuscus). A date, il ne semble toutefois pas que les chauves-souris soient impliquées dans l'épizootie de rage sylvatique qui sévit en Orntario.

An Outbreak of Toxoplasmosis in an Ontario Chinchilla Herd.

An outbreak of toxoplasmosis which killed 44 of a herd of 56 chinchillas and produced 4 abortions with the loss of a total of five fetuses is reported. A wild mouse thought to be the house mouse (Mus musculus), caught in a trap in the basement housing the chinchillas, was found to be infected with Toxoplasma gondii. The suggestion is made of the existence of a reservoir of infestation in wildlife with wild rodents implicated in this case as possible transmitters of the disease. The post mortem findings, histopathological, serological, and bacteriological results of work done on 6 dead and two live chinchillas and the wild mouse are also reported. A brief review of the literature dealing with toxoplasmosis in this species (Chinchilla lanigera) is presented.

Epizootiologic Studies Of Shipping Fever: II. Exposure Of Calves To Pasteurellae and Para-lnfluenza 3 Virus.

In four trials, the exposure of six calves to various stressors and an aerosol of pasteurellae did not evoke significant responses. In ten trials, 20 calves were exposed by aerosol or intratracheal injection to myxovirus para-influenza 3 (PI3) alone or combined with pasteurellae. A respiratory syndrome similar to that observed in mild cases of shipping fever was regularly reproduced in calves which had low serum hemagglutination titers to PI3. One calf developed a severe bronchopneumonia, was killed and the virus was reisolated from its lungs. Exposure to P13 plus pasteurellae usually resulted in an increased nasal discharge. The stressors employed in a few trials did not significantly alter the response.

A Comparison of the Viruses of Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR), Infectious Pustular Vulvovaginitis (IPV), and Rinderpest: Part I. Studies of Antigenic Relationships.

The viruses of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), infectious pustular vulvovaginitis (IPV), and rinderpest were compared by specific methods. The results further confirmed that IBR and IPV are caused by agents with common antigens. No antigenic relationship was found between these viruses and rinderpest virus, which confirms earlier work.

The Effect of Acepromazine Maleate on Feeder Steers in Transit and Feedlot.

The tranquilizer, acepromazine maleate, was evaluated using 34 yearling Hereford feeder steers. Animals injected prior to loading lost significantly less weight (29.5%) during transit from Edmonton to Winnipeg than their untreated counterparts. The weight loss difference following arrival at Macdonald College, Quebec, was not significant. During a short term feeding period the group fed ace promazine maleate gained significantly more rapidly (12.8%) than the control group. There were no significant differences in dressing percentage or carcass grade.

Suprapubic Cystotomy in a Stallion.

A five-year-old Thoroughbred stallion had been showing urinary incontinence with staining of the hind legs for some time, and was in poor physical condition. On rectal examination a large calculus was palpated in the urinary bladder. Urine culture revealed a Proteus infection. The calculus, weighing 420 gm., was removed by laparo-cystotomy, using a left paramedian approach well anterior to the external inguinal ring. Anaesthesia was maintained with halothane during the operation. Aftercare included treatment with antibiotics, a diuretic, hot fomentations on the edematous area, and mild exercise. The stallion made a complete recovery, and was discharged twenty-seven days post-operatively.

Anatomy of the Canine Skull in Low-grade Otocephaly.

An inherited low-grade otocephaly in a strain of Beagles was studied. All cases were "mild" with partial agnathia a constant feature in the adult animal. One case of high-grade otocephaly with aprosopus was recorded in an outcrossed animal. Neonatal mortalities in the low-grade type were associated with gross patency of the parietal fontanelle and hydrocephaly. Enlarged lateral ventricles were found in adult dogs, associated with incomplete union of the cranial sutures and occasional membranous-like paietal bone replacement over the patent fontanelle. Partial agnathia was not obvious in the neonate, but became apparent during postnatal skeletal development. The major anatomical differences in the skulls of these dogs were compared with normal Beagles. Malocclusion of the lower mandible and teeth against the upper jaw during development may have resulted in changes in length and width of the upper jaw and certain cranial structures. It was thought that the maloccluding lower jaw acted as a wedge against the upper jaw during mastication and these abnormal pressures, transmitted in an upward, forward, and outward direction, caused lengthening and widening of the palatine and temporal bones, and lengthening of the premaxilla and nasal bones. The nasopharyngeal meatus and palatine fissures were narrower and elongated. The pterygoid processes were pulled into a more horizontal position. It was suggested that a primary inherited abnormality may cause secondary changes in contiguous structures during development, and differentiation between primary (genetic) and secondary (acquired) anatomical abnormalities should be considered.

Ruminant Mineral Nutrition. The Effect of Copper Injections on Weight Gains and Haemoglobin Levels of Cattle Pastured on Ground-Water Soils in The British Columbia Interior.

Fifteen cattle, with the typical copper deficiency symptoms of scouring and emaciation, gained .45 pound more daily after receiving copper injections than the control group in a three-month period. Copper injections did not prevent scouring on this ranch in the North Okanagan Valley. Copper deficiency symptoms have occurred in this area whenever cattle have been restricted to forage from ground-water soils though animals improve when moved to upland soils. Dairy calves and beef cattle are most frequently affected. Subclinical deficiencies may be more important economically than the easily recognized severe deficiencies.The average copper level in pasture forage on this ranch was 10.2 ppm and copper content of forage was not related to scouring. The average molybdenum level was 8.8 ppm but the molybdenum content of 9.7 ppm in affected forage was high compared to 2.2 ppm in forage from a pasture where scouring did not occur and 4.2 ppm in pasture which caused less scouring. The average copper to molybdenum ratio was 1.0 in the affected forage which was low compared to the ratio of 4.3 in forage from the pasture where scouring did not occur and 2.3 in forage from the pasture where there was less scouring. Manganese tended to be higher in non-scouring forage. Sulphur contents were high but not related to the degree of scouring. In a 1957 survey on farms not far from this ranch, no difference was found between the copper and molybdenum contents of scouring and non-scouring forage though copper was double and molybdenum comparable to levels found on this ranch. However, in the survey, scouring forage contained .65 per cent sulphur whereas non-scouring forage only contained .26 per cent.

A Comparison of The Viruses of Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR), Infectious Pustular Vulvovaginitis (IPV), and Rinderpest Part II. Plaque Assay.

A plaque assay procedure was used successfully for studying the viruses of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), infectious pustular vulvovaginitis (IPV), and rinderpest. The plaques produced by the IBR and IPV viruses were indistinguishable, but differed from those of rinderpest. The viruses were neutralized by their respective antisera as indicated by plaque inhibition. Plaques formed by the IBR and IPV viruses were inhibited by homologous and heterologous antisera but not by rinderpest antisera, while those of rinderpest were inhibited by the rinderpest antisera only.

Noncytopathogenic Bovine Viral Diarrhea Viruses Detected and Titrated by Immunofluorescence.

Noncytopathogenic (NCP) bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) disease agents can be detected and titrated in tissue culture systems by a method employing immunofluorescence. Cytopathogenic (CP) and NCP viruses cross react with fluorescein-conjugated serum globulins produced against either CP and NCP viruses, but the fluorescence is more intense in the homologous system. Serum neutralization titers of sera against both CP and NCP groups were compared for both groups of viruses, and results of cross reactions were in agreement with results from immunofluorescence tests. Results of these two tests were discussed as to possible antigenic groupings of CP and NCP viruses. Use of immunofluorescence as a diagnostic test for BVD and as an alternate method of titrating NCP viruses in tissue culture systems is proposed.

Western Equine Encephalitis in Saskatchewan Reptiles and Amphibians, 1961-1963.

Western equine encephalitis (WEE) antibodies were found in blood samples from garter snakes and leopard frogs collected in Saskatchewan but WEE virus was not recovered from any of the specimens. Evidence of natural WEE infection in snakes was found in 8 different localities while in frogs in two only. Experimentally, garter snakes were readily infected and developed a high, relatively sustained viremia without signs of disease. After experimental exposure, viremia persisted regularly for 10 to 12 days, while the longest observed duration of viremia was 30 days. Anamnestic responses were elicited in snakes as a result of second inoculations of virus after the antibody levels from first exposures had fallen. Newborn snakes were observed to be more sensitive to infection than adults. The possibility of virus and antibody transmission from infected pregnant garter snakes to their offspring was investigated. Snakes and frogs were both susceptible to infection by the oral route. Two bull snakes collected at Steveville, Alberta, were found to have antibody for St. Louis Encephalitis virus.

Viral Plasmacytosis (Aleutian Disease) in Mink: IV. Cytoplasmic Glycoprotein Inclusions and Their Differentiation from the Viral Inclusions of Distemper.

The periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) method was found to be a convenient stain for differentiating the specific intracytoplasmic inclusions of distemper from similar eosinophilic inclusions seen in plasmacytosis and occasionally in other disease conditions of mink. These latter inclusions stained strongly with PAS and appeared to be composed of glycoprotein. Although their significance is not known, it is probable that they represent abnormal globulins produced in great excess by the proliferating plasma cells. A pathogenetic hypothesis is offered.

The Properties and Classification of Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus.

Examination of the C24V (Oregon) and MAC A (Ontario) strains of bovine viral diarrhea viruses have shown them to be ribonucleic acid containing viruses, with essential lipid and having compound helical symmetry with the diameter of the helix being in the neighbourhood of 180 A. Because of these properties it is suggested that the virus should be considered a member of the Myxovirus group. Hog cholera virus is related to bovine viral diarrhea virus by means of a "soluble" antigen, and also possesses essential lipid. It is therefore suggested that hog cholera virus represents still another veterinary myxovirus.

Effect of 2-(a Hydroxybenzyl) Benzimidazole on Teschen Disease Virus, Pig Enteric Viruses, and Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus in Kidney Cell Cultures.

The synthetic compound, 2-((a) hydroxybenzyl) benzimidazole (HBB) partially inhibited the cytopathogenicity and multiplication of Teschen disease virus (TDV) and 6 enteric-cytopathogenic porcine orphan (ECPO) viruses in swine cells but not of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) in bovine kidney cells. For FMDV, there appeared to be a slight enhancement in virus yield and in cytopathic effect when HBB was present. The inhibition of the viral cytopathic effect and reproduction of TDV and ECPO viruses was related to the concentration of HBB. At the inhibitory level, the compound did not cause any changes in the microscopic structure of pig kidney or bovine kidney cells. The suppression of TDV multiplication was reversed when HBB was removed. The compound did not inactivate TDV or FMDV.

Anomalous Origin of the Coronary Arteries in Two Calves.

ANOMALITIES OF THE CORONARY ARTERIES MAY INCLUDE ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING VARIATIONS: abnormal number, abnormal course, or abnormal origin. Many of these anomalies have been described in man.((28)) Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (A.O.L.C.A.) has been estimated ((19)) to occur in one of 300,000 children and to represent approximately 0.5% of all types of congenital heart disease. In a recent review((28)) of these conditions in man, anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (A.O.R.C.A.) had been reported 16 times, A.O.L.C.A. 39 times, and anomalous origin of both coronary arteries from the pulmonary artery (A.O.B.C.A.) 5 times.A review of the available literature disclosed 12 reports ((3,6,8,10,20,23,24,25,26,27,31 & 32)) of anomalies of the coronary arteries in animals. Four of these reports ((10, 20, 31 & 32)) described A.O.R.C.A. in cattle. This review failed to disclose any accounts of A.O.B.C.A. in that species. The purpose of this paper is to describe the findings of two cases of A.O.B.C.A. in cattle.

Production of Antibody in Mammary Gland of Pregnant, Non-Lactating and Lactating Cows, Evoked by Polyvalent Antigen with Reference to Dosage and Frequency of Immunization.

Sixteen cows were used in a series of experiments to test dose, route and frequency responses in the production of milk and serum agglutinins to a spectrum of 9 proven bovine pathogens. The bacterial species were: Pasteurella multocida (2 isolates), Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus albus, Streptococcus sp., Corynebacterium sp., Salmonella enteriditis, and Aerobacter aerogenes. Primary immunizations were made either through the teat canal or intramuscularly. "Booster" injections were made through the teat canal. Agglutinins in the blood appeared only after a week or more. In the milk, titers were recorded in 1 or 2 days following primary immunization. Variation of titer in the blood and milk was somewhat independent. In all but 1 cow, antibody was produced against each organism in milk and blood serum. Udder inflammation was observed in the experiments when a 15-day interval separated immunizations. Inflammation was minimal in the experiments employing the 7-day interval of immunization. A positive Whiteside test was observed following most injections, even where no other clinical signs of reaction were seen. The findings are discussed in relation to the previous literature.

A Soluble Precipitating Antigen From Hog Cholera Virus Propagated in Tissue Culture: I. Preparation and Characterization of the Antigen.

A precipitating hog cholera viral antigen was produced in a swine kidney tissue culture system. This antigen produced a single, sharp precipitin line with reference antiserum but no precipitin lines with nonimmune control sera. The precipitating antigen was present in the supernatant fluid after high-speed centrifugation, and was readily separated from infective virus by diethylaminoethyl cellulose (DEAE) chromatography. The antigen was found to be nondialyzable, stable to the action of chloroform and to storage at refrigeration temperature for at least 7 mo, but was inactivated at 56 C in 30 min.

A Phylogenetic Analysis of Behavioral Neuro-ontogeny in Precocial and Nonprecocial Mammals.

Studies of the postnatal development of two groups of mammals are discussed in relation to behavioral change correlated with neurophysiological and anatomical data. The precocial mammals include especially the ruminants (sheep, cow; also horse and guineapig) while the nonprecocial mammals, which require a long period of nursing, include man and the primates, carnivores and rodents. Common features of certain neurological aspects of development are closely compared in this latter group to emphasize the importance of selected age studies to give correlative data from a wide variety of altricious species. For example, the relative age of a 1-2 week old mouse is equivalent to a 3-4 week old dog or 3 months in man in some behavioral features. The postnatal development of these several species is closely paralleled, but common features of the mother-offspring relationship, especially in dog and man, are not seen in the precocial mammals which are physiologically more independent at birth. These observations indicate that in the field of comparative medicine there is much to contribute by interpolating and extrapolating correlative data from different species. Some of this data in the neurologic field has been brought together in this paper, for especially in developmental and pediatric studies it is desirable to have cross-species data on relative postnatal ages in relation to the degree of maturity of the organism.

Myelogenous Leukemia in a Cat, Complicated by an Acute Otitis Media.

A six year old male cat with a history of three days' anorexia was presented for examination. He carried his head down on the left side, circled to the left, showed incoordination and displayed marked nystagmus. The right pupil was dilated; the left, constricted. Both pupils exhibited poor photomotor reflexes. Examination of the left external ear canal revealed inflammatory debris and elicited a severe pain reaction. Blood studies throughout the 8-day period showed a rising white blood cell count, with predominantly abnormal primitive granulocytic series cells in the peripheral blood and crowding out the normal bone marrow cells. Anaemia was also shown to be developing. The cat was given supportive and symptomatic therapy while in the clinic. Eight days following admission he died. Post mortem examination showed that the left tympanic bulla was softened and filled with purulent material, and that the 8th nerve was inflamed and hemorrhagic. The spleen was enlarged and the bone marrow showed termendous cellularity. Microscopic examination showed that the spleen, kidney cortex and portal areas of the liver had been infiltrated by leucocytes with abnormal nuclei; as had the circulatory systems of the liver, spleen, bone marrow and brain. These findings led to a diagnosis of myelogenous leukemia and an acute otitis media.

The Anthelmintic Activity of 0,0-dimethyl-0-1,2-dibromo-2,2-dichloroethyl phosphate for Canine Hookworms.

In a statistical study involving 18 adult dogs an enterically coated, tableted formulation of 0,0-dimethyl-0-1,2-dibromo-2,2-dichloroethyl phosphate was found to clear 86.5 per cent of the dogs of hookworm infections when given orally at a level of 15 mg./kg. for 2 consecutive days and 50 per cent when it was given at the same level once. The per-cent efficacy for hookworm removal was 70 and 78 per cent respectively. The dogs were infected with both A. caninum and U. stenocephala. Other concurrent helminth infections were also present.No vomitions, symptoms, or lesions of drug toxicity were observed in the medicated dogs.

Measurement of Bone Growth in Osteopetrosis.

Day-old chicks were injected with 0.2 ml. of a suspension of lymphomatosis virus which was known to cause osteopetrosis in a high percentage of susceptible birds. A comparable number of uninoculated chicks were kept for controls. Alizarin red S was administered for the purpose of marking the bones in order to measure the rate of growth of normal bone and the osteopetrotic bone. The dye was given at 27, 41 and 55 days of age. In this experiment it was found that a layer of normal bone was formed on the surface of the tibia at a rate of 0.25 mm. per week but in the largest osteopetrotic lesion that was found in any chicken spongy bone was formed at a rate greater than 1 mm. per week. Alizarin red S was irritating to tissue and was toxic when given intravenously.

Studies of Johne's Disease in Canada: XI. Complement-Fixation Titres and Blood Cell Picture.

Complement-fixation titres and haemograms were determined monthly during a period of approximately one year for nine cattle with Johne's disease. Three of four experimentally infected animals died during the interval or shortly afterwards; all three developed high complement-fixing titres with Johne's bacillus antigen. The experimentally infected animal that survived was serologically reactive for a few months, then became negative. One of the naturally infected cows exhibited a relatively high complement-fixing titre throughout but the other four were serologically negative or occasionally weekly reactive. All nine cattle showed a variable degree of neutrophilia and lymphopaenia but an absolute eosinopaenia was observed only in the three that died.

Passage of I-albumin and I-gamma globulin into the small intestine of the pig.

Metabolism of I(131)-albumin and I(125)-gamma globulin was examined simultaneously in 5 pigs (22-30 kg. bodyweight). Total daily catabolism of albumin and gamma globulin was 12-23 per cent/day and 10-13 per cent/day rsp. The excretion of the two proteins into the small intestine was studied in Thiry-Vella type loops, situated at different levels of the small intestine. Considerable amounts of protein-bound radio-activity could be detected in succus entericus. Perfusions with isotonic magnesium sulphate solution, normal saline and 10 per cent magnesium sulphate solution were followed by increased excretion of both proteins. The increase was very considerable, even when isotonic fluids were used. The excretion of the two proteins was of the same order of magnitude. Quantitative aspects are discussed with special reference to the difficulties derived from the fact that little is known on secretory variations along the intestine and on the role played by the passage of digesta in the excretion of proteins.

Electrophoretic and Chemical Studies on Sera of Swine Following the Feeding of Toxic Groundnut Meal.

The consumption of toxic groundnut meal by swine leads to marked alterations in their electrophoretic serum patterns. Experiments carried out by chemical assays and by the moving boundary electrophoretic method of Tiselius and Smithies' starch gel electrophoresis showed a relative decrease in the albumin, alpha(1)-, alpha(2)-, and beta globulins, while gamma globulin appeared to be considerably increased.

Enteritis of Early Weaned Pigs : II. Pathogenesis.

Strains of hemolytic E. coli are implicated in edema disease and enteritis of swine. Immunological experiments were conducted to determine the specific role played by hemolytic E. coli in the etiology of these diseases. When cell-free extracts prepared from a frequently isolated E. coli - 0139:K82(B) were injected 48 hours apart into a healthy pig, symptoms of edema disease were produced on both occasions. Similar symptoms were produced when this extract was injected into a colostrum-deprived pig raised in isolation. The Schultz-Dale reaction revealed no difference between the contractions of the ilea of sensitized and non-sensitized guinea-pigs. In vitro treatment of a single non-sensitized guinea-pig uterus with extracts of five different strains of hemolytic E. coli produced sharp contractions in every trial. A similar treatment with extracts of four non-hemolytic E. coli strains also stimulated the non-sensitized guinea-pig uterus but the magnitude of the contractions was much less. These studies indicated that the cell-free extracts of hemolytic E. coli produced a marked nonspecific toxic reaction.

Hog Cholera: I. Investigation of the Agar Double-Diffusion Precipitation Test for The Detection of the Virus in Swine Tissue.

The agar double-diffusion precipitation test was investigated to detect hog cholera virus in splenic and pancreatic tissues of swine. Special attention was given to the conditions influencing the sensitivity and specificity of the test. These studies emphasize the strict techniques and methods required in the test in order to detect specific antigen - antibody reaction. Absorption studies performed on serum fractions prepared by DEAE cellulose chromatography and studied electrophoretically, indicated the specific reaction was given by fractions, migrating in the gamma-globulin region and was absorbed by infected but not by normal spleens. The sensitivity of the test is dependent to a great extent on the successful liberation of the viral antigen from the tissue.

Cancer of the bladder. Combined 5-fluorouracil and cobalt-60 teletherapy.

Three major attacks have previously been used on invasive carcinoma of the urinary bladder - surgical extirpation, irradiation therapy and chemotherapy. Of the chemotherapeutic agents, only systemic 5-fluorouracil has proved to possess merit. In a study of therapy with a judicious combination of these three therapeutic approaches in 32 cases, it appeared that tumor response was better and there were fewer major complications than with therapy by any one method. The report is preliminary, as the period of observation in not yet long enough.

Iron loading and the liver: the effect on regeneration after partial hepatectomy.

The gain in weight and incidence of mitosis of the posterior lobes of iron-loaded and control rats are compared following partial hepatectomy. The percentage gain in weight of the regenerating livers over the first 72 hours was similar in the two groups, but at 11 days and 12 weeks growth of the iron-loaded livers was less than that of the controls. An increased incidence of mitosis was found in the iron-loaded rats, both before and after partial hepatectomy.

Mammalian chromosomes in vitro. XVII. Idiogram of the Chinese hamster.

From 67 diploid male Chinese hamster cells in vitro, an idiogram was constructed. The chromosomes can be classified into 4 natural groups: group I, 2 pairs of large submetacentrics (1 and 2); group II, 3 pairs of medium-sized submetacentrics (the sex pair, 4 and 5); group III, 3 pairs of medium-sized subtelocentrics (6,7, and 8); group IV, 3 pairs of small metacentrics (9,10, and 11). A system of subdividing each chromosome into regions is also suggested.

Lead in the bones of prehistoric lead-glaze potters.

In 1932 Haury described lead-glaze pottery from the Southwest. In view of his report, it appeared desirable to find out whether the makers of such pottery suffered from lead poisoning. A series of 46 bone specimens from Kinishba, where lead-glaze pottery was made, and a control series of 33 specimens from Point of Pines, where such pottery is not known to have been made, were screened by X-ray and by X-ray diffraction. The 11 most promising specimens were then analyzed by atomic absorbtion spectrophotometry. Lead was found in quantities believed to be below the toxic range; concentrations in the control series from Point of Pines were, with few exceptions, higher than in the experimental series from Kinishba.

The effects of some centrally acting drugs on ganglionic transmission in the cat.

Transmission through the cat superior cervical ganglion was studied by recording the response of the nictitating membrane to both pre- and postganglionic cervical sympathetic nerve stimulation. The intra-arterial injection of central depressant drugs to the ganglion through the lingual artery depressed transmission through the ganglion. The central depressant drugs tested were (in decreasing order of activity): amylobarbitone, pentobarbitone, carbromal, benactyzine, mephobarbitone, hydroxyzine, phenobarbitone, azacyclonol, methylpentynol carbamate, paraldehyde, phenytoin, mephenesin, chlorbutol, troxidone, methylpentynol and barbitone. All were weaker ganglion-blocking agents than tetraethylammonium. The intra-arterial injection of the central stimulant drugs leptazol, bemegride, amiphenazole and 5-(1,3-dimethylbut-2-enyl)-5-ethylbarbituric acid (McN 481) also depressed ganglionic transmission. Leptazol or bemegride did not antagonize the ganglion-blocking action of amylobarbitone or troxidone. The intra-arterial injection of pecazine and perphenazine, and the intravenous injection of barbitone, benactyzine, azacyclonol, hydroxyzine, mephenesin, methylpentynol and paraldehyde impaired the response of the nictitating membrane to both post- and preganglionic stimulation. The implications of these observations are discussed.

Applications of Results from Linear Kinetics to the Hodgkin-Huxley Equations.

On the basis of its role in the analysis of mammillary compartmental systems, a matrix with non-zero elements in the first row, first column, and along the main diagonal and with zero elements elsewhere is called a mammillary matrix. It is pointed out that such matrices occur in a variety of biological problems including the linearized Hodgkin-Huxley equations (H-H). In considering whether such a linear system exhibits stability (all roots of the matrix with negative real parts) it is of interest to seek conditions, expressible in a simple manner in terms of the matrix elements, which lead to stability or instability. For the case when the diagonal elements, with the possible exception of the first, are negative (a condition physically guaranteed for the space-clamped axon) simple criteria for instability and stability are formulated in terms of the matrix elements. These criteria are derived by extending previous results from linear kinetics through appeal to a classical matrix theorem without recourse to the characteristic polynomial. The relation of these mathematical results to the work of Chandler, FitzHugh, and Cole on the space-clamped axon is discussed. The results are in no way restricted by the order of the matrix (which is four for the H-H equations) and other possible applications are noted.

Wheat: Reconstitution of the Tetraploid Component (AABB) of Hexaploids.

The tetraploid AABB genomic component of two varieties of common hexaploid wheat (AABBDD; 2n = 42) was reconstituted by a simple back-crossing technique in which known phylogenetic relationships between the hexaploid and tetraploid groups of Triticum were used. The reconstituted tetraploids do not closely resemble commonly described varieties of the present-day group of tetraploid species. The plants are dwarfed, lack vigor, and are partially or completely self-sterile, depending on the variety of the hexaploid source. Chromosome pairing is similar to that observed in a variety of durum wheat (AABB; 2n = 28). Synthetic hexaploids derived from hybrids between one of the reconstituted tetraploids and several strains of Aegilops squarrosa (D genome) are of normal growth and vigr and are highly fertile.

Stretch Receptor-Like Organs in the Fly Larva: Their Possible Role in Growth Regulation.

Typical insect stretch receptors and receptor-like organs present in larvae of Sarcophaga bullata and other flies contain associated cells which are suspected of passing secretory products into "target" organs by way of strands of connective tissue. In the fly larva, such organs are attached to leg rudiments, tracheal discs, muscles, the genital disc and gonads, and may be concerned with the neuroendocrine control of metamorphosis of these structures.

Student Performance in New High School Biology Programs.

Data on the effectiveness of the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study course were obtained from several sources, including experimental use with 65,000 students. Any of the three versions of this biology course can be taught to average and above-average 10th-grade students. Achievement on the associated comprehensive test is more closely related to the ability and sex of the student, the salary of the teacher, the proportion of graduates of the school who go to college, the size of the class, and the adequacy of laboratory facilities than to the version of the course.

Salt Migration to the Northwest Body of Great Salt Lake, Utah.

Interchange of saline lake water between the northwest body of Great Salt Lake, Utah, comprising about one-third of the lake area, and the main body of the lake, has been severely restricted by the completion of a railroad embankment across the lake in 1959. The northwest body has a relatively small volume of inflow and a somewhat greater rate of evaporation than the main body. As a result, there has been a net flow of saline water northward and accompanying deposition of a thick layer of salt over the bottom and shore of the northwest body. A unique set of hydrologic and physical-chemical influences are in action, and further important effects on the entire lake are expected.

Allotropy in Some Rare-Earth Metals at High Pressures.

Allotropes of lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and neodymiumc have been observed at elevated pressures with an x-ray diffraction camera which incorporates a diamondanvil, high-pressure cell. In each case a high-pressure modification was observed which has a face-centered cubic structure. At room temperature the unit cell dimensions (alphao) for the high-pressure face-centered cubic structures and approximate pressures at which they were determined are as follows: La, 5.17 A(23 kb); Ce, 4.82 A(15 kb); Pr, 4.88 A(40 kb); and Nd, 4.80 A(50 kb). The unit cell dimensions for the high-pressure forms of La, Pr, and Nd apparently have never been reported.

Ferric Tourmaline from Mexico.

Dark brown crystals, up to 10 mm long, occur in rhyolite at Mexquitic, San Luis Potosi, Mexico. They are short prismatic, showing {1120}, {3030}, {1011}, {0221}, with c/a 0.4521, measured with a goniometer, and distinct {1120} cleavage. With an unusual combination of cell dimensions, high density, high refractive indices, and extreme birefringence, this tourmaline falls outside the known elbaite-schorl and schorl-dravite series. A chemical analysis, recalculated on the basis of cell volume and density, gives close to the theoretical 150 atoms per cell, whether the iron is ferrous or ferric, but the physical properties indicate a ferric tourmaline.

Ferrosilite (FeSiO3): Synthesis at High Pressures and Temperatures.

The FeSiO(3) (ferrosilite) end member of the pyroxene series is not known as a pure mineral in nature and cannot be synthesized at atmospheric pressure. It is readily synthesized, however, at pressures from 18 to 45 kb and temperatures from 1150 degrees to 1400 degrees C. Its refractive indices approach those predicted for ferrosilite and it melts incongruently to an Fe, SiO(4)-rich liquid plus quartz.

The age of trees growing on the moraines of a small, high-altitude glacier in the Canadian Rockies suggests that the date of the maximum post-Pleistocene ice advance was around A.D. 1714, with another later advance about 1832. These two dates are synchronous with the two major periods of recent ice advance in the area.

Amethyst: Optical Properties and Paramagnetic Resonance.

Color centers in amethyst are produced by the action of ionizing radiation on precursor centers that arise from substitution of Fe(+3) for Si(+4) in the alpha-quartz structure. These Fe(+3) centers provide the dominant features of the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum of amethyst. The three equivalent Si(+4) sites are unequally occupied by Fe(+3), a circumstance that explains the optical biaxiality of amethyst.

Solar Neutrons and the Earth's Radiation Belts.

The intensity and spectrum of solar neutrons in the vicinity of the earth are calculated on the assumption that the low-energy protons recently detected in balloon and satellite flights are products of solar neutron decay. The solar-neutron flux thus obtained exceeds the global average cosmic-ray neutron leakage above 10 Mev, indicating that it may be an important source of both the inner and outer radiation belts. Neutron measurements in the atmosphere are reviewed and several features of the data are found to be consistent with the estimated solar neutron spectrum.

Inherited Male-Producing Factor in an Insect That Produces Its Males from Unfertilized Eggs.

An inherited factor causing the normal sex ratio of 92 percent females to drop to about 5 percent has been produced by selective breeding in a laboratory strain of the arrhenotokous parasitic wasp Dahlbominus fuliginosus (Nees) (Hymenoptera, Eulophidae). The factor is known to be of genetic origin and is sex-limited, being transmitted by females to their sons. Its effect on the sex ratio is constant and not influenced by the female parent, the host, or the environment.

Stishovite: Thermal Dependence of the Crystal Habit.

The crystal habit of stishovite changes with the temperature of crystallization at a pressure of about 120 kb. Below 600 degrees C it is bipyramidal; between 600 degrees and 900 degrees C it is granular; and above 900 degrees C it is acicular. This temperature dependence of the crystal habit of stishovite may constitute a highpressure geological thermometer which could indicate limiting values for the peak temperatures that prevailed at craters of meteoritic origin in highly siliceous rocks. It suggests that natural acicular stishovite from the rim sandstone at Meteor Crater, Arizona, crystallized at temperatures above 900 degrees C.

Rhenium and Osmium Abundances in Stony Meteorites.

Neutron activation measurements of rhenium and osmium abundances in the Orgueil, Mokoia, Karoonda, Mocs, and Hvittis chondrites indicate no fractionation of these elementsbetween the various chondrite types. The average abundances in chondritic material are RE = 60.3 X 10(-9)g/g and Os =710 X 10(-9)g/g (Os/ Re = 11.5). The rhenium abundance in the Bishopville enstatite achondrite is about 1/300 as much, and the osmium abundances about 1/100 as much, as theabundances in parental enstatite chondrites, indicating that most of the rhenium and osmium in the enstatite chondrites is in the metallic phase.

Crude estimates of ages by fission-track counting should be possiblewith considerable labor for the group of glasses which was found to have the highest concentration of uranium.

Growth Response of the d-5 and an-1 Mutants of Maize to Some Kaurene Derivatives.

Replacement of the exocyclic methylene groupattached to ring D by a keto-, methyl-, hydroxymethyl-, carboxy-, or methylcarboxy group resulted in compounds which were biologically inactive. These kaurene derivatives are structurally related to the gibberellins which produce a similar type of elongation for the d-5 and an-1 mutants.

Carbon Monoxide Production by a Bathypelagic Siphonophore.

A physonectid siphonophore, Nanomia bijuga, associated with a verticallymigrating deep scattering layer, has been observed with a gasfilled float at depths in excess of 300 meters in the sea. This implies that gas is secreted and maintained in the pneumatophore against a diffusion gradient of 30 atmospheres or more. Analysis of the enclosed gases revealed concentrations of carbon monoxide exceeding 90 percent. Necessary voiding of this gas during a vertical ascent of 300 meters could give rise to a transient population of bubbles which would act as sound-reflecting targets.

Morphology of Microtubules of Plant Cell.

The microtubules present in the cortices of plant cells are found to have a wall made up of slender filamentous subunits, probably 13 in number, which have a center-to-center spacing of about 45 angstrom units. Thus the micromorphology of these tubules is similar to that reported for the 9 + 2 fibrils of rat sperm flagella. This structure can be used to account for a primary function of motion attributable to the microtubules.

Circadian Leaf Movements: Persistence in Bean Plants Grown in Continuous High-Intensity Light.

A circadian leaf movement has been found in Phaseolus vulgaris var. Pinto that will persist under constant temperature and continuous fluorescent light. The period of leaf movement was approximately 26 hours in length, and the amplitude did not diminish for at least 4 weeks. Leaf movements were similar for plants grown in either 1100, 4950, 7700, or 10,450 lumens per square meter. This is the first clearly defined persistent circadian rhythm reported for leaves of higher plants.

Neutron and Proton Dosages in the Upper Atmosphere from Solar Flare Radiation.

The radiation dosage from secondary neutrons as well as from primary and secondary protons in the earth's atmosphere during solar particle events is calculated as a function of the solar proton flux, atmospheric depth, and geomagnetic-cutoff rigidity. The dosage in rems from secondary neutrons exceeds the dosage from protons below 30 g/cm(2) of residual atmosphere. Neutron dosages in rads are less than the dosage from primary protons at all depths above 100 g/cm(2). The maximum neutron dose to travelers in supersonic aircraft during solar particle events of the magnitude observed during the last solar cycle would be of the order of I rem.

Strain-Induced Birefringence in Fluoride Films on Uranium Dioxide.

Optically birefringent microstructures are formed within fluoride films that are produced on uranium dioxide by hydrofluorination. The positive molar volume change of the reaction produces nonuniform tensile and compressive stresses around sites of surface roughness which result in optical double refraction.

Sterols in Recent Aquatic Sediments.

The presence of sterols in recent fresh-water sediments was confirmed and, for the first time, sterols were found to be widely distributed throughout recent marine sediments. Quantities ranged from 60 to 300 parts of cholesterol carbon per million parts of organic carbon in the sediments. No correlation of sterol content with environment or depth of burial in the sediment was apparent.

Erratum.

In the report "Neutron and proton dosages in the upper atmosphere from solar flare radiation" by E. J. Flamm and R. E. Lingenfelter (26 June, p. 1566), the factor 1/micro should be eliminated from Eqs. 2, 3a, and 3b. This correction reduces the calculated neutron and proton doses by approximately 50 percent but does not otherwise alter the conclusions drawn from the calculation. The authors thank Dr. I. M. Karp for pointing out this error.

Ancient Granite Gneiss in the Black Hills, South Dakota.

Granite gneiss, with an age of approximately 2.5 billion years, in the Black Hills, South Dakota, provides a link between ancient rocks in western Wyoming and Montana and in eastern North and South Dakota and Minnesota. The discovery suggests that early Precambrian rocks covered an extensive area in northcentral United States and were not restricted to several small nuclei.

High-Pressure Polymorph of Iron.

An x-ray diffraction study of iron under pressure has shown that alpha-iron (body-centered cubic) transforms to hexagonal-close-packing (designated epsilon-iron) at 130 kb, room temperature. The volume change for the transformation is -0.20 +/- 0.03 cm2/ mole. The slope for the gamma-epsilon phase boundary has been calculated to be 2 +/- 1 degrees C/kb. The molar volume of iron decreases from 7.10 cm3/mole (density = 7.85 g/cm(3)) at room pressure to 6.10 +/- 0.08 cm(3)/mole (density = 9.1 +/- 0.1 g/cm(3)) at 200 kb and room temperature. The extrapolation of the gamma-epsilon phase boundary, consistent with shock wave data, suggests that it may have an influence on the properties of the earth's core.

Magnesium Compounds: New Dense Phases.

Magnesium silicide (Mg3Si) undergoes a transformation from a cubic (fluorite) type lattice to a hexagonal lattice at pressures above about 25 kilobars and temperatures above 900 degrees C. There is an increase of density of about 15 percent associated with this structure change. Both the parent and product substances are semiconductors, but of different resistivities. The high pressure phase may be recovered and is indefinitely metastable at normal ambient conditions.

X-ray Diffraction Data on Two High-Pressure Phases of Calcium Carbonate.

X-ray diffraction studies conducted at high pressure with a beryllium pressure vessel show that compression parallel to the c-axis of CaCO(3)-I (calcite), as the phase boundary of CaCO-(3)II (modified calcite type) is approached, results in a relative reduction of the c-axis of phase II of several times that of the a-axes. Such data are not consistent with previously proposed anion disorder in CaCO(3)-II. At 18.7 +/- .5 kb and room temperature a new phase of CaCO3 has been observed that is assumed to be phase III found by Bridgman. At this pressure the x-ray diffraction pattern can be indexed as orthorhombic KNO3-IV type, with a0 = 8.90 +/- .01 A, b0 = 8.42 +/- .01 A, and c0 = 7.14 +/- .01 A (Z = 10).

Amitrole Translocation in Agropyron repens Increased by the Addition of Ammonium Thiocyanate.

The mechanism for the enhancement of amitrole activity on quackgrass (Agropyron repens) by the addition of ammonium thiocyanate was studied. Absorption and translocation of C(14)-amitrole after applications to foliage were determined by a direct count of the radioactivity in the wash solution and plant extracts. Regardless of the time of application, the addition of ammonium thiocyanate did not alter the amount of C(14)-amitrole absorbed. Ammonium thiocyanate (5000 parts per million) greatly increased the amount of carbon-14 translocated. This increase may account for the greater herbicidal effectiveness of the mixture of amitrole and ammonium thiocyanate.

X-ray Diffraction Studies on Dysprosium at High Pressures.

Dysprosium has been studied at pressures up to about 160 kilobars, well above the transition reported near 50 kilobars by other workers. It shows no definite structural alteration from hexagonal close-packed structure throughout this range. It is suggested that the 50-kilobar transition is most likely electronic or magnetic in nature, or that the metal undergoes a hexagonal stacking rearrangement.

High Pressure: Effect on Dysprosium.

The electrical resistance of dysprosium was studied in the temperature-pressure range 77 degrees to 200 degrees K and 15 to 120 kb. The variations of the Néel transition with pressure was found to good accuracy, the value of dT(N)/dP being-0.62+/-0.4 deg/kb. From this result, second-order thermodynamic equations yield values of -64 x 10-6 ( degrees C)(-1) and 4.0 x 10(-14) cm(2)/dyne for the changes in the coefficient of linear expansion and the compressibility, respectively, at the 1-atm Néel point. The Néel transition disappears at 45 to 55 kb, and no magnetic transitions are seen at higher pressures in the temperature range indicated. The other boundaries in the region investigated have been determined but are very uncertain. The cause of the cusp in the isothermal compressions is not clear from the available data. Above the Néel boundary, the pressure dependence of the cusp with respect to temperature, dP/dT, is very small and may even be zero. Below the Néel temperature, dP/dT is uncertain. From isothermal measurements, the value is -1, while from the isobaric measurements a value of -0.25 is obtained.

Recent High Relative Sea Level Stand near Recife, Brazil.

Radiocarbon dates for Vermetidae limestone from the edge of the Brazilian Shield at Cape San Agostinho, Brazil, indicate sea level stands of up to 2.60 meters above the present position, 3660, 2790, and 1190 years ago. Accurate determination of relative sea level is possible because of the well-defined habitat of the fossils dated.

Intracellular Regulatory Mechanisms: Regulation in multicellular forms may be an elaboration upon the pattern evolved in microorganisms.

The study of metabolic regulation in microorganisms has revealed several simple but efficient regulatory circuits. In one, the operation of an entire sequence of enzymes is controlled by the activity of the initial enzyme which contains a specific inhibitor site. When this site is combined with the endproduct of the sequence, the catalytic site is rendered inactive. In another, the formation of an entire sequence of enzymes is controlled by means of a cytoplasmic mediator which blocks the transcription of the genetic message (repression) when activated by the endproduct, or which allows the transcription (induction) when activated by the substrate of the first enzyme in the sequence. Additional circuits have been proposed for the regulation of RNA and DNA synthesis. The same regulatory devices could account, in part, for intracellular metabolic control in more complex animal and plant forms. However, superimposed upon these simple control circuits will be found others which take advantage of the greater degree of organization in these cells and of the possibilities for regulating gene function that are provided by the chromosomes. The pattern of proteins with special control sites, such as have evolved in the relatively simple controls found in bacteria, may also be found essential for intercellular controls involving nervous and humoral mechanisms.

Calcite-Dolomite-Magnesite Stability Relations in Solutions at Elevated Temperatures.

The stability relations of calcite, dolomite, and magnesite in aqueous CaCl(2)-MgCl(2)-CO(2) solutions have been determined between 275 degrees and 420 degrees C. Small quantities of the carbonates were allowed to equilibrate with large volumes of aqueous solutions, permitting the approach of phase boundaries from two directions. Experimental data indicate that the stability field of calcite narrows toward higher temperatures, dolomite is incongruently soluble, and magnesite stability extends into the calcium-rich portion of the system.

Potassium-Argon and Lead-Alpha Ages of Plutonic Rocks, Bokan Mountain Area, Alaska.

Most of the granitic rocks in the Bokan Mountain area, southeastern Alaska, are early Paleozoic (probably Ordovician) judged by potassium-argon and lead-alpha age measurements. The Bokan Mountain Granite, the youngest intrusive unit in the area, belongs to a Mesozoic plutonic episode. These age measurements are the first direct evidence for the emplacement of early Paleozoic granitic intrusive rocks close to the Pacific margin of North America.

Origin of Ice Ages: Pollen Evidence from Arctic Alaska.

Pollen analysis of radiocarbon-dated samples from the arctic coastal plain of Alaska shows that vegetation of 14,000 years ago reflected a climate colder than the present, and that there has been a progressive warming, culminating in the present cold arctic climate. The record indicates that the Arctic Ocean has been covered with ice since the time of the Wisconsin glacial maximum, suggesting that the essential condition of the Ewing and Donn hypothesis for the origin of ice ages, that the Arctic Ocean be ice-free up to 11,000 years ago, cannot be met.

Planetary Systems Associated with Main-Sequence Stars.

The luminosity function is used to estimate the number of invisible planet-like objects in the neighborhood of the sun, taking into account the likely chemical composition of planets in relation to the composition of main-sequence stars. There may be about 60 objects more massive than Mars for every visible star. An attempt is made to estimate the distribution of these planet-like cold bodies in relation to stars. It is suggested that stars, together with cold objects, were formed in clusters of bodies of random size distribution. Clusters averaging about 50 bodies each account for the observed distribution of frequencies of double and triple star systems relative to single stars. On this basis, virtually every star should have a planetary system associated with it. As a corollary, systems of cold bodies in which there are no luminous stars should be abundant. The possible distribution of planets around such stars has been studied, making use of the observed orbital characteristics of double star systems. It is concluded that favorable conditions for life processes may be far more abundant than has generally been thought possible.

Isotopic Composition of Lead and Strontium from Ascension and Gough Islands.

Isotopic composition of lead and strontium has been determined in a series of rock samples from two islands on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Both interand intra-island variations exist in the abundance of radiogenic isotopes of both elements. Lead from basalt of Ascension Island has a Pb(206)-Pb(204) ratio of 19.5, while the corresponding ratio at Gough Island is only 18.4. The Pb(208)-Pb(204) ratios from the two islands do not differ. Conversely, strontium from basalt of Ascension Island is less radiogenic than that from Gough Island basalts. The trachytes of both islands have lead and strontium that is more radiogenic than that found in the basalts. The inter-island differences indicate the existence of regional variations in the uranium-lead and rubidium-strontium ratios of the upper mantle source of these rocks and show that isotope compositions are a means for investigating chemical heterogeneities in the mantle.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Superconducting Magnetic Fields.

The first high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer operated at 30 Mcy/sec (7.05 kilogauss). The magnets constituted the only major obstacle to raising the frequency, but by continuous development over 10 years this frequency for proton resonance was increased to 100 Mcy/sec (23.4 kilogauss). Now, in one step, a system has been made to operate at twice this frequency and field intensity. It is not expected that superconducting magnets will generally replace iron magnets, but it is interesting to note that very few laboratories use the 30- and 40-Mcy/sec proton systems today. Notwithstanding the cost and operating problems of the superconducting magnet system for the nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer, the fact that this is the only practical means of developing both a stable and a high-intensity field puts it in a class by itself. For this reason, even though the maintenance of spectrometers with superconducting magnets requires rather specialized skills, this type of instrumentation will clearly have an important role in advancing scientific knowledge, by making possible analyses which have not been possible with presently available instruments.

High-Voltage Laue X-ray Photography of Large Single Crystals.

The technique can be used for determining the orientation spread of subcrystal units and for studying the loss of primary extinction due to occluded chemical impurities. An advantage of this method is its possible application to crystals inside polycrystalline or glass containers.

Sodium Perxenate and Xenon (II) Difluoride Reduction at the Dropping-Mercury Electrode.

Sodium perxenate in alkaline solutions is reduced in a single step to xenon at the dropping-mercury electrode. The half-wave potential for perxenate changes from -0.21 to -0.31 volts against a Hg(2)SO(4)-Hg reference electrode in the pH range 10.1 to 11.3. Xenon (II) difluoride in acidic solution is reduced in a single step to xenon, at the potential of approximately zero against the Hg2SO4-Hg reference electrode. The reduction wave is followed by a broad maximum which can be effectively suppressed by fluoride ion. The diffusion current varies in linear fashion with concentration.

Glacier Geophysics: Dynamic response of glaciers to changing climate may shed light on processes in the earth's interior.

From physical measurements on glaciers and experimental studies of ice properties a framework of concept and theory is being built which bids fair to place glaciers among the more quantitatively understandable phenomena in the earth sciences. Measurements of flow velocity, deformation and stress, ice thickness and channel configuration, temperature, internal structure of theice, mass and energy balance, and response to meteorological variables all contribute to this understanding, as do still other measurements hardly discussed here, such as electrical properties, radioactive age measurements, and detailed studies of chemical and isotopic composition. The obvious goals of this work-the interpretation of past and present glacier fluctuations in terms of changes in world climate, and the prediction of glacier behavior-remain elusive, even though a good conceptual groundwork has been laid for dealing with the more tractable aspects of these problems. Intriguing recent discoveries have been made about such matters as the way in which glaciers react dynamically to changing conditions, the inter-relations between thermal regime and ice motion, the structural mechanisms of glacier flow, and the changes produced in ice by flow. One can recognize in these developments the possibility that concepts derived from the study of glacier flow may be applicable to phenomena of solid deformation deep in the earth. In this way glacier geophysics may have a useful impact beyond the study of glaciers themselves.

Infrared Surveys of Hawaiian Volcanoes: Aerial surveys with infrared imaging radiometer depict volcanic thermal patterns and structural features.

Aerial infrared-sensor surveys of Kilauea volcano have depicted the areal extent and the relative intensity of abnormal thermal features in the caldera area of the volcano and along its associated rift zones. Many of these anomalies show correlation with visible steaming and reflect convective transfer of heat to the surface from subterranean sources. Structural details of the volcano, some not evident from surface observation, are also delineated by their thermal abnormalities. Several changes were observed in the patterns of infrared emission during the period of study; two such changes show correlation in location with subsequent eruptions, but the cause-and-effect relationship is uncertain. Thermal anomalies were also observed on the southwest flank of Mauna Loa; images of other volcanoes on the island of Hawaii, and of Haleakala on the island of Maui, revealed no thermal abnormalities. Approximately 25 large springs issuing into the ocean around the periphery of Hawaii have been detected. Infrared emission varies widely with surface texture and composition, suggesting that similar observations may have value for estimating surface conditions on the moon or planets.

Observed concentrations of Be(7), Na(22), Mn(54), Co(60), Y(88), Zr(95)-Nb(25), Ru(166), Sb(124), Sb(125), Cs(134), Cs(137), and Ce(144) during the past 2(1/2) years help to explain the origin and fallout rates of the trace radionuclides in air.

Spalled, Aerodynamically Modified Moldavite from Slavice, Moravia, Czechoslovakia.

A Czechoslovakian tektite or moldavite shows clear, indirect evidence of aerodynamic ablation. This large tektite has the shape of a teartdrop, with a strongly convex, deeply corroded, but clearly identifiable front and a planoconvex,- relatively . smooth, posterior surface. In spite of much erosion and corrosion, demarcation of the posterior and the anterior part of the specimen (the keel) is clearly preserved locally. This specimen provides the first tangible evidence that moldavites entered the atmosphere cold, probably at a velocity exceeding 5 kilometers per second; the restult was selective heating of the anterior face and perhaps ablation during the second melting. This provides evidence of the extraterrestial origin of moldavites.

Quantized Magnetic Flux in Superconductors: Experiments confirm Fritz London's early concept that superconductivity is a macroscopic quantum phenomenon.

The observation that the magnetic flux in a hollow superconducting cylinder is quantized in units of hc/2e has confirmed Fritz London's prediction that superconductivity is a macroscopic quantum phenomenon and that the superconducting state is a single- valued quantum state. It has also conclusively demonstrated that the pair interaction of the Bardeen-Cooper- Schrieffer theory of superconductivity is the important one, at least for the few superconductors studied. A superconducting ring or hollow cylinder must "decide" at the transition temperature what final quantum state it will be in when the temperature is lowered. This "thinking process" has been observed in experiments which demonstrate that the free energy of a hollow superconducting cylinder at the transition temperature is periodic in the magnetic flux. Very recently quantum-mechanical interference effects have been observed in the Josephson tunneling characteristics of multiply linked superconducting circuits. These experiments complement the other experiments on quantized flux and provide perhaps the most elegant proof of long-range order in the superconducting state.

Sonar Probing in Narragansett Bay.

A 12-kilocycle pulsed transducer, with a 0.1 millisecond duration, is used for tracing a sub-bottom rock profile in Narragansett Bay. The short sonar pulse of high energy is produced by a capacitor discharge. Over-the-side installation of the transducer permits the use of any boat or ship for the survey work. Coherent presentation of the data on a wet paper recorder gives an instantaneous visual record. A cross a north-south rock formation, a recurring rise and fall of the rock is shown throughout the sedimentary deposit.

Analogs of thymine caused a nonspecific growth inhibition without suppressing two-dimensional growth. The effects of the analogs were reversed by the respective bases or their derivatives.

Helium Difluoride: Possible Preparative Techniques Based on Nuclear Transmutations.

It might be possible to prepare difluoride by beta decay of tritium, lithium-6 transmutation, or alpha-particle bombardment. In the first method, which may be the most feasible, tritiated potassium bifluoride could be used as a host lattice. The beta-decay recoil energy would not dislodge the daughter helium atom from the host site, thus helium difluoride could perhaps be formed in an ideally shaped lattice site.

Reduction of Transpiration of Leaves through Stomatal Closure Induced by Alkenylsuccinic Acids.

Low concentrations of long-chain alkenylsuccinic acids and certain of their derivatives inhibit stomatal opening in a tobacco-leaf disk assay, and when used as a spray. The monomethyl ester of decenylsuccinic acid is presently the most effective of this class of compounds. Stomatal closure induced with this substance is accompanied by a significant reduction in the rate of transpiration. These inhibitors probably close stomata by altering the permeability of the membranes of the guard cells.

Tritium-Hydrologic Research: Some Results of the U.S. Geological Survey Research Program.

In general tritium is of limited usefulness as a tool in hydrologic studies because the tritium content of ground water, as a result of radioactive decay, becomes too low to be detectable after about 50 years. Nevertheless, a unique study was made of the hydrologic cycle of small stream basins in Wisconsin and New Jersey on the basis of measurements relative to the peak of tritium fallout in the spring of 1958. The continental and the coastal basins receivedapproximately the same tritium fallout. Approximately 30 percent went into ground-water storage, the remainder being exported as runoff and evapotranspiration. The mean residence time for ground-water recharge for the two basins was 45 and 30 days, respectively.

The geographic rangeof the geologically younger families Leptestheriidae and Limnadidae (particularly the genus Eulimnadia) thus extended to Chihuahua during post-Mesozoic time.

Asynchronous Synthesis of RNA in Nucleoli of Root Meristem.

During pulse incubations of onion roots with RNA precursors, incorporation into meristematic nucleoli is asynchronous for some, but not for all, cells. After a 30-minute labeling period, the "zero-class" is as large as 25 percent, and the asynchrony is intracellular rather than cellular. This suggests an individual specificity of nucleolar function in a population of differentiating cells.

Atmospheric Aldehydes Related to Petunia Leaf Damage.

Snowstorm petunias grown in the greenhouse developed a necrotic banding of the actively expanding foliage characteristic of injury ascribed to various photochemically produced pollutants in the atmosphere. In this case the damage appeared to be related to the high aldehyde content of the ambient air. Each time the aldehyde concentration exceeded 0.20 parts per million for 2 hours, injury appeared within a day or two. From July to September 1963 such plant injury was observed on seven occasions.

Coal Mine Disasters: Frequency by Month.

Major coal mine disasters (five or more fatalities per accident) in the United States over the past 150 years have tended to occur primarily in the winter months from November through April. Minor accidents (zero to four fatalities per accident) occur at a fairly uniform rate throughout the year. This peak for major disasters is ascribed to effect of barometric minima on the methane content of mine air, to the effect of dry polar air masses in reducing the moisture content of coal dust, and, possibly, to cyclic fatigue of rock structures from cycling barometric pressure. Obvious safety practices are suggested.

Geometry of Bermuda Calcareous Dune Cross-Bedding.

Bermuda wind-blown limesands are lobate-shaped bodies composed internally of leeward foreset strata which dip at 30 to 35 degrees and windward strata which dip at 10 to 15 degrees in an opposite direction. The foreset beds are convex upward. This convex upward cross-stratification is preserved because of the early stabilization of the eolian calcareous sand due to surface cementation by percolating rain water.

Geological Aspects of High-Pressure Research: High-pressure experimentation is providing a new look at problems in geophysics and petrology.

The low-density minerals that make up the bulk of rocks in the earth's crust, such as quartz and the feldspars, are transformed by high pressure into much denser phases. In some cases the products of these transitions are new phases that were first discovered in the laboratory; in other cases they are minerals such as kyanite, jadeite, and pyrope, which have long been known as constituents of metamorphic rocks. Determinations of the stability fields of these high-pressure minerals show that either metamorphism of sedimentary rocks takes place at much greater depth than has hitherto been supposed or pressures generated by orogenic forces may have significantly augmented the hydrostatic pressure. The second alternative seems unlikely, but lack of information on the strength of rocks during metamorphism makes the matter uncertain. Geophysical and petrological observations indicate that the dominant rock type in the upper mantle is garnet peridotite. However, there is reason to believe that the mantle is inhomogeneous and that a variety of rocks ranging in bulk composition from eclogite to peridotite are present. Hydrous phases, such as amphiboles, are possible constituents in the upper 100 kilometers. The hypothesis that the Mohorovicić discontinuity is a dynamic equilibrium between basalt and eclogite seems improbable. The transition zone between the upper and lower mantle can be explained as a series of reactions in which silicates with the silicon ion in fourfold coordination are transformed into phases in which silicon is in six-fold coordination. This interpretation is supported by synthesis of stishovite, a polymorph of SiO(2) with rutile structure, and by syntheses of germanate pyroxenes with ilmenite structure. Data on the melting of silicates at pressures up to 50 kilobars show that the initial dT/dP slopes of silicate melting curves are much steeper than those of metals but that they show considerable curvature. The increase of melting temperature with pressure should be much more pronounced near the top of the mantle than at greater depth.

Viscosity and Self-Diffusion of Liquid Metals.

It is demonstrated that the empirical relationship between activation energy of viscosity and the melting point of a metal is also true for the energy of self-diffusion, in view of the Stokes-Einstein relation. The provision is that viscosity and self-diffusion be expressed in a self-consistent manner, as provided, for example, by the J. Frenkel's theory of liquids. Thus, one can now estimate either the viscosity or the self-diffusion of any metal over a substantial temperature range from its known melting point.

Dendrites: Understanding of this familiar phenomenon has led to the development of useful man-made materials.

I have touched upon the great variety of crystal forms and dendritic forms in nature, have discussed the essential physics involved in the generation of these forms during either constrained or unconstrained crystal growth, and have shown how this knowledge helps in the classification of this seemingly infinite variety of forms. Man has built upon this understanding to control the form and dimensions of certain materials to his technological advantage. We may hope that, in the future, we will have greater understanding of these phenomena of natural crystal growth and the ability to use this knowledge for technological ends.

Underwater Sound: Deep-Ocean Propagation: Variations of temperature and pressure have great influence on the propagation of sound in the ocean.

The absorption of sound in sea water varies markedly with frequency, being much greater at high than at low frequencies. It is sufficiently small at frequencies below several kilocycles per second, however, to permit propagation to thousands of miles. Oceanographic factors produce variations in sound velocity with depth, and these variations have a strong influence on long-range propagation. The deep ocean is characterized by a strong channel, generally at a depth of 500 to 1500 meters. In addition to guided propagation in this channel, the velocity structure gives rise to strongly peaked propagation from surface sources to surface receivers 48 to 56 kilometers away, with strong shadow zones of weak intensity in between. The near-surface shadow zone, in the latter case, may be filled in by bottom reflections or near-surface guided propagation due to a surface isothermal layer. The near-surface shadow zones can be avoided with certainty only through locating sources and receivers deep in the ocean.

Graphitization of Organic Material in a Progressively Metamorphosed Precambrian Iron Formation.

Organic matter in the sedimentary Biwabik iron formation in northern Minnesota shows a progressive increase in crystallinity where the formation is metamorphosed by the intrusive Duluth gabbro complex. X-ray diffraction of acid-insoluble residues shows that there is a complete range in crystallinity, from amorphous material in the unmetamorphosed sediments to completely crystalline graphite adjacent to the gabbro.

Meteoritic Zircon.

Zircon (ZrSiO(5)) has been identified as an accessory mineral in the Vaca Muerta mesosiderite and in the troilite nodules of the Toluca iron meteorite. The occurrence in Vaca Muerta is a new discovery confirmned by electron-probe nmicroanalysis of a grain in a polished section of the meteorite. Our identification of zircon in Toluca substantiates an occurrence in this meteorite reported in 1895 by Laspeyres and Kaiser.

Geology of the Crust and Mantle, Western United States: Geophysical data reveal a thin crust and anomalous upper mantle characteristic of active regions.

Seismic refraction, gravity, phase velocity, and magnetic data, coupled with the geologic record, are all approximately satisfied by the structure shown in Fig. 9. A 20-kilometer crust under the Coast Ranges and Great Valley thickens to more than 30 kilometers under the Sierra Nevada and parts of the Basin and Range province; this whole area is underlain by an anomalous upper mantle with a velocity and density about 3 percent less than normal. It is not likely that the anomalous mantle extends much deeper than 50 kilometers, and the lower boundary may be gradational. The thicker crust or "root" under the Sierran highland region (Sierra Nevada and western Basin Ranges) is not limited to the Sierra Nevada proper. The root and the voluminous plustonic rocks originated in the Mesozoic era, and they constitute the now consolidated core of the Cordilleran eugeosyncline. But it must not be supposed that the root has persisted unchanged. The great mountain-building uplifts in the Cenozoic era must have been accompanied by large changes in the root and adjacent mantle. A zone of positive gravity and magnetic anomalies extending the length of the Great Valley is associated with mafic rocks of the western Sierra greenstone belt, an element of the Cordilleran eugeosyncline. Belts of maficto-intermediate lavas, accompanied by mafic and ultramafic intrusions, are marked by similar anomalies in other ancient geosynclines. An anomalous upper mantle of plagioclase peridotite, an expanded phase of the normal mantle, could explain about 1 kilometer of the uplift that took place over much of the region in Cenozoic time. To explain all of the Cenozoic uplift in the Sierra Nevada and Basin Ranges by this means would require the hypothesis of a separation of the anomalous mantle into crust and normal mantle fractions, followed by a renewal of the anomalous mantle through the action of regional convection currents or local overturning in the upper mantle. The low-velocity zones for compressional and transverse waves in the upper mantle may be related to this problem. Whatever its origin and composition, an anomalous upper mantle characterizes many regions of present or recent tectonic activity, such as Japan and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (39). The anomalous mantle of western North America might form a continuous belt to the south, with anomalous mantle beneath the crest of the East Pacific Rise (40). The anomalous upper mantle may thus be an essential part of the heat engine driving the tectonic activity of these regions. The Basin and Range region was broken into blocks and laterally extended during the Cenozoic uplift, so that some blocks lagged behind, or sank. Some of the intricate disruption of the upper crust may be related to shallow Cenozoic volcanism. The relatively large and rigid Sierra Nevada block may have been tilted westward during Basin-Range deformation because of the high density of greenstones on the west side and the lower density of granitic rocks to the east. Man's environment, in the longer view of geologic time, is strongly influenced by mountain-building processes originating in the earth's crust and mantle. In the scale of a few lifetimes, climate, sea level, and the shape of the land are appreciably altered. How this comes about, and whether man can hope to influence the processes, are challenging, unsolved problems. But enough has now been learned about the crust and mantle to suggest precisely what questions must be answered and what critical experiments performed. Note added in proof: Osborne (42) has directed our attention to the possibility that the granitic rocks and also the andesites and dacites were formed by fractional crystallization of basaltic magma under conditions of high oxygen pressure. This possibility in no way conflicts with the geophysical data. In fact, such direct additions to the silicic upper crust from the mantle or lower crust would simplify the perplexing problem of how the crust is replenished in areas of great erosion.

Variations of Nitrogen-15 Abundance in Soils.

A survey of the isotopic composition of soil nitrogen has shown that there is variation in the abundance of nitrogen-15 in soils and in different forms of soil nitrogen. The variation detected is small, but it cannot be attributed to analytical errors and should be considered in studies of nitrogen transformation in soils when nitrogen-15 is used as a tracer.

Differences in the Amino Acid Composition of a Third Rabbit Antibody.

Antibody directed against a neutral hapten, p-amino-beta-phenyl lactoside, has been purified, and its amino acid composition has been determined.

The demonstration of a third unique antibody composition supports the hypothesis that the amino acid differences are related to specificity rather than to the heterogeneity of gamma-globulin.

Brucella-Agglutinating Antibodies: Relation of Mercaptoethanol Stability to Complement Fixation.

Brucella-agglutinating antibodies from selected bovine blood serums and milk samples did not fix complement, and after treatment with 2-mercaptoethanol they lost agglutinating power. After infection of calves with Brucella abortus, strain 19, agglutinins for Brucella that were inactivated by mercaptoethanol appeared earlier than those stable to mercaptoethanol. Under the conditions of these experiments, the appearance and development of complement-fixing capacity coincided closely with the mercaptoethanol stability of the agglutinins for Brucella.

Olfactory Discrimination: Electrophysiological Spatiotemporal Basis.

Simultaneous recordings were taken from two widely separated branches of the olfactory nerve of the frog. Odors from a variety of chemical substances were blown into the nares, and each elicited a different response magnitude ratio between the two branches. In addition, the time lapse between the two nerve responses differed for different chemicals. This suggests a time-space encoding of the mucosal response to odors.

Variation in the Monoterpenes of Pinus Ponderosa Laws.

Wide differences from tree to tree were found in the monoterpene composition of the wood oleoresin of ponderosa pines located in the same geographic area in California. Differences attributable to variation within the tree, to the season of sampling, to the year of sampling, and to methods of analysis by gas chromatography were only slight. There may be an inverse relation between the amounts of Delta(3)(-) carene and beta-pinene in a given tree.

Dissociation of Olfactory Neural Response and Mucosal Potential.

The olfactory mucosal slow potential decreased remarkably or disappeared when part of the mucus on the olfactory epithelium was removed with absorbent paper. In contrast, the neural response was not changed much, while unitary spikes in response to odor also appeared in the epithelium. The paper reduced the thicknèss of the mucus by about half, but olfactory cilia were still present. This evidence suggests that the slow potential is not the generator potential.

Persistence of Bacteria in "Protoplast" Form after Apparent Cure of Pyelonephritis in Rats.

Appropriate antibiotic treatment of experimental enterococcal pyelonephritis in the rat appears to effect the removal of the infecting organisms from the kidney, as judged by the culturing of kidney homogenates on standard bacteriological media. When the homogenates were cultured on media containing 0.3M sucrose, osmotically stabilized, it was demonstrated that bacteria were present in the "protoplast" form, and that this form persisted in the kidney for at least 13 weeks after therapy.

Experimental Reversal of Germ Cells in Ovaries of Fetal Mice.

When heterosexual pairs of gonads of fetal mice were homotransplanted in close contact with each other below the kidney capsule of castrated adult hosts, the testis developed normally for this environment, but the ovary became an ovotestis. The medulla of the ovotestis contained dilated seminiferous tubules in which spermatogenesis progressed to the point at which secondary spermatocytes were produced. Under these conditions, germ cells, genetically determined as ova, underwent differentiation toward spermatozoa. This is the second clear case of germ cell reversal by experimental means in a mammalian species.

The Exploding Galaxy M82: Evidence for the Existence of a Large-Scale Magnetic Field.

Photographs of galaxy M82 obtained in blue light show the existence of a previously unknown system of large-scale filaments extending 4000 parsec (1.2 X 10(22) cm) above and below the fundamental plane of the galaxy along the minor axis. These filaments emit continuous radiation that is highly polarized, with the electric vector predominately perpendicular to the filamentary structure. A plausible interpretation is that the radiation is optical synchrotron emission caused by relativistic electrons spiraling in a large-scale magnetic field. To produce radiation in visual wavelengths, the electron energies must be in the range 10(3) to 10(4) Bev if the magnetic field is between 10(-5) and 10(-6) gauss.

Fission Damage in Calcite and the Dating of Carbonates.

Fission damage induced in calcite is shown by etch pits developed with weak acid at the damage sites. The damage can be differentiated from dislocations by annealing. By this method we have observed fossil fission damage in natural samples. Thus, some etch pits previously attributed to dislocations actually result from such damage. Annealing studies indicate that the damage should persist for about 4 x 10(7) years at 50 degrees C, and direct evidence suggests that the fission damage has persisted for at least 10(4) years in one specimen.

Molecular Structure of the Synthetic Molecular Oxygen Carrier O2IrCl(CO)(P[C6H5]3)2.

The synthetic molecular oxygen carrier O(2)lrCl(CO)(P[C(6)H(5)](3))(2), discovered by Vaska, has been characterized in a complete molecular structure determination. The structure surmised by Vaska from spectroscopic data has been confirmed and, in addition, definitive details on the attachment of molecular oxygen to iridium in this 1 : 1 reversible oxygen carrier have been obtained. The two oxygen atoms are equidistant from the metal atom, as in Griffith's model of the oxygen atoms in oxyhemoglobin. The O-O bond length of 1.30 +/- 0.03 A is intermediate between those characteristic of O(2) (1.20 A) and O(2)(-2) (1.48 A), and corresponds closely to O(2)(-)(1.28 A).

Cosmic Electromagnetic Radiation: The sky shine covers an enormous spectrum of frequencies, revealing a cosmic picture in some detail.

Within a few decades astronomy has extended the compass of its observations from the visible spectrum downward to radio waves and upward to the highest energies known to science. The major new accomplishments are in the radio and x-ray bands, and in the associated study of cosmic ray electrons. Synchrotron radiation is known to be a mechanism for radio signals; discrete x-ray sources have been found; the intensity and the charge ratio of galactic electrons are under study. Experimental results at energies above the x-ray region are less firm. The sun surely emits gamma rays at energies of about 1 Mev during flare activity, and instruments in deep space have probably recorded the general galactic glow of similar photons. Upper limits for fluxes have been set at 100 Mev and beyond. To some extent the physical processes which give rise to the extraterrestrial radiation are familiar to workers in the terrestrial laboratory. Synchrotron radiation is an example; the bremsstrahlung of electrons, the production of neutral pions in p-p collisions, and the annihilation of electron and nucleon pairs are others. Some proposed mechanisms are, and perhaps always will be, purely speculative in the sense that they are not directly observable in the laboratory. The inverse Compton effect, possibly one of the sources of a metagalactic sky glow of hard photons, is in this class. There is little chance that spontaneous creation of matter, even if it occurs in nature, can be observed on a terrestrial scale. And the extreme physical conditions proposed for neutron stars are beyond our ability to reproduce. Only through interpretation of astronomical data can we test the validity of these ideas. The many pictures of the universe given by the vast electromagnetic spectrum are essential to the synthesis of our concepts.

Pollen Accumulation Rates: Estimates from Late-Glacial Sediment of Rogers Lake.

Absolute pollen deposition in a Connecticut lake over a 4000-year interval has been estimated from pollen frequencies in a core of late-glacial sediment dated by radiocarbon techniques. The rate of total sediment accumulation as measured after burial was statistically constant at 0.036 centimeter per year, but the rate of deposition of pollen grains onto the sediment increased from 600 to 900 grains 14,000 years ago to 9000 per square centimeter per year 10,000 years ago. A major increase in the deposition of tree pollen occurred about 11,500 years ago, at the beginning of the spruce pollen zone. Presentation of data in conventional (percentage) form masks the magnitude of this change and distorts many of the changes in accumulation rates for individual types of pollen; moreover it magnifies statistical variation in the herb zone where all pollen is scarce.

Pentaborate Polyanion in the Crystal Structure of Ulexite, NaCaB5O6(OH)6{middle dot}5H2O.

Triclinic ulexite crystals contain isolated borate polyanions [B(5)O(6)(OH)(6)](3-) related to the well known pentaborate polyanion [B(5)O(6)(OH)(4)](-) by addition of two hydroxyl groups to two opposite B-O triangles. The isolated ulexite polyanions form the [B(5)O(7)(OH)(4)](n)(3n-) chains previously found in crystals of the related mineral probertite, NaCaB(5)O(7)(OH)(4).3H(2)O.

Kope Formation (Upper Ordovician): Ohio and Kentucky.

Eden-like strata near Maysville, Kentucky, may be correlated with the Eden and lower Fairview formations of Cincinnati. To avoid the name Eden, which has stadial connotation, these rocks are included in the Kope formation, defined as medium-bedded limy shales (mean clastic ratio, 2.5 to 3.8) resting conformably between shaly Point Pleasant limestones (mean clastic ratio, 1.0) and unnamed shaly limestones (mean clastic ratio, 0.5).

Libration of Pluto-Neptune.

Numerical integration of the orbits of the five outer planets over 120,000 years reveals that the distance between Pluto and Neptune at the closest approaches oscillates within a narrow range. The distance is never much less than the aphelion distance of Pluto from the orbit of Neptune. The near commensurability in the periods of Pluto and Neptune and the eccentricity of Pluto's orbit are responsible for the libratory motion.

Oxygen Isotope Fractionation between Coexisting Calcite and Dolomite.

The oxygen isotopic composition of calcite from carbonate rocks of the lower unit of the Flagstaff formation (Paleocene) exposed along the western margin of the Wasatch Plateau, Utah, is about 7 per mil lower than that of coexisting dolomite, suggesting that isotopic equilibration of these two minerals can occur at relatively low temperatures. Unlike recent isotopic evidence presented by Degens and Epstein, the data do not preclude a primary chemical origin for the dolomite.

Mononuclear and Polynuclear Chemistry of Rhenium (III): Its Pronounced Homophilicity.

Extensive chemical, spectrophotometric, and x-ray structural studies have shown that trivalent rhenium is strongly homophilic-that is, it tends to form bonds to other Re(111) atoms-and it forms at least three different series of [ReX(4)](n)(n-) complexes. The mononuclear, square complex, [ReBr(4)](-), adds two water molecules to give trans-[ReBr(4)(H(2)O)(2)](-). The binuclear complexes [Re(2)Cl(8)](2-) and [Re(2)Br(8)](2-) have strong Re-Re bonds, unsupported by halide bridges. The trinuclear species, [Re(3)X(12)](3-) or Re(3)X(9)L(3), contain the triangular Re(3)X(9) clusters. Use of ReCI(3) appears always to lead directly to products containing Re(3)Cl(9); this unit exists in ReCl(3) itself and does not appear to be kinetically labile. The [Re(2)X(8)](2-) ions are obtained by reduction of ReO(4)(-) in aqueous HCl or HBr. Salts of [ReBr(4)(H(2)O)(2)](-) can be obtained directly from solutions of ReBr(3) in HBr along with numerous other compounds, some containing trinuclear clusters.

The experimental establishment by an International Society of a coordinated group of worldwide regional conferences on an annual basis for 4 years, succeeded in the 5th year by a giant congress which is of the nature of a review and which is honestly social, is suggested as an alternative scheme to the present situation, which may be summed up as follows: the rigidity of some national societies, the haphazard expansion of regional meetings, and the cynical extravagance of huge congresses-of which the success is measured only by size, and from which both science and friendship are being squeezed out.

Growth of Oxalic Acid Single Crystals from Solution: Solvent Effects on Crystal Habit.

Single crystals of oxalic acid dihydrate are difficult to grow from pure water solution, but good single crystals of the material may be obtained by growth from mixtures of acetone and water. The solvent markedly affects the crystal habit. Crystals grown in mixtures of acetone and water develop the prismatic habit, while those grown in water alone develop the tabular or equant habit. The forms {001}, {110}, and {101} predominate in all cases. Single crystals of anhydrous oxalic acid may also be grown from solution in glacial acetic acid, although specimens more than 2 centimeters in length are difficult to produce.

Electrolytic Conductance of Sea Water: Effect of Calcium Carbonate Dissolution.

Calcium carbonate dissolution in the presence of excess carbon dioxide increased the specific conductance of sea water by approximately 6 x 10(-5) ohm(-1)cm(-1) per millimole of carbonate dissolved. The observed conductance increase can be explained by the partial equivalent conductance of calcium bicarbonate and by the hindrance effect of uncharged carbon dioxide dissolved in sea water.

Origin of High-Alumina Basalt, Andesite, and Dacite Magmas.

The typical volcanic rocks of most island arcs and eugeosynclines, and of some continental environments, are basalt, andesite, and dacite, of high alumina content. The high-alumina basalt differs from tholeiitic basalt primarily in having a greater content of the components of calcic plagioclase. Laboratory data indicate that in the upper mantle, below the level at which the basaltic component of mantle rock is transformed by pressure to eclogite or pyroxenite, the entire basaltic portion probably is melted within a narrow temperature range, but that above the level of that transformation plagioclase is melted selectively before pyroxene over a wide temperature range. The broad spectrum of high-alumina magmas may represent widely varying degrees of partial melting above the transformation level, whereas narrow-spectrum tholeiite magma may represent more complete melting beneath it.

Prehistoric Archeological Surveys and Excavations in Afghanistan: 1959-1960 and 1961-1963.

Afghanistan has long been considered an important transmitter of culture in the historic periods. Buddhism, for example, reached the Far East from Gandhara (the classical name for southern Afghanistan and parts of north-western West Pakistan). Recent research indicates that the foothills of northern Afghanistan may have been one of the early centers of incipient agriculture, transitional between the food gathering of the Paleolithic and the food production of the Neolithic. In addition, Upper and possibly Middle ("Mousterian") Paleolithic industries have been identified.

Fission-Track Ages and Track-Annealing Behavior of Some Micas.

The density of tracks from spontaneously fissioning uranium atoms in mica has been used to make quantitative measurements of geologic ages. In comparison with methods in which ages are derived from measurements of radioactive decay products, the fission track method is much simpler and is usually accurate for micas up to a few hundred million years old. Annealing experiments suggest that high ambient temperatures are responsible for track fading in the older samples.

Marine Sediments: Effects of a Tube-Building Polychaete.

The marine tube-building polychaete, Owenia fusiformis, selects sand grains of tablet form for its tube. It can concentrate the mineral hornblende at least 25-fold and these concentrations may persist after the death of the worm. Owenia and a small anemone, Zaolutus actius, can act together to stabilize the sand surface against movement by wave surge. The result is the formation of an area of stabilized substrate, with which characteristic animals and plants are associated, in the midst of a region of shifting granular substrate.

Cesium in Liriodendron and Other Woody Species: Organic Bonding Sites.

In trees labeled with cesium-137, the isotope in the sap streams is primarily in the free ionic form. Much ionic Cs(137) also appears to occur in intracellular fluids other than the sap streams. However, a small quantity of Cs(137) forms ionic bonds with organic compounds (probably as salts of carboxylic acids). Even though most of the activity appears in the phloem tissue, some activity is dispersed in much of the sapwood and even in the dead xylem tissue of the heartwood. Some of this Cs(137) is retained, at least temporarily, by the numerous carboxylic groups of the natural plant compounds of cell walls, cytoplasm of living cells, and cell debris of heartwood.

Gibberellins: Their Effect on Antheridium Formation in Fern Gametophytes.

Gametophytes of the fern Anemia phyllitidis respond to seven different gibberellins (A(1), A(3); A(4), A(5), A(7), A(8), and A(9)) by forming antheridia. Gibberellin A(7) is active at concentrations as low as 5 X 10(-10) g/ ml. Species from two of the three other genera in the family Schizaeaceae respond similarly to gibberellin A(3). In contrast, nearly 40 species from 7 other families of ferns do not develop antheridia when supplied with gibberellin.

Global Distribution of the Net Energy Balance of the Atmosphere from Tiros Radiation Data.

The radiation data from Tiros II and Tiros III have been analyzed to obtain the monthly averages of the global distribution of the total outgoing radiation from the earth. These data have been combined with climatological estimates of the incoming radiation for the same periods to obtain monthly averages of the regional distribution of the net energy balance. The results show that these data could be useful in studies of the meridional circulation and the evolution of large-scale weather systems.

As expected, either decreasing K(+) concentration or increasing Ca(++) concentration increased the resistance.

Acropetal movement is slight, probably non-metabolic, and essentially constant. Amounts transported are linearly dependent on the absorbing area exposed to tracer solution.

Positive-Ion Chemistry: High Yields of Heavy Hydrocarbons from Solid Methane by Ionizing Radiation.

At 77 degrees K solid methane is polymerized rapidly and efficiently to heavy hydrocarbons by cobalt-60 gamma rays. The product is a viscous oil consisting mainly of saturated and highly branched hydrocarbons containing an average of about 20 carbon atoms per molecule. This would seem to be evidence for positiveion chemical reactions in the solid state analogous to those previously reported to occur in the gaseous state at pressures above 0.01 mm-Hg. It would thus appear that the solar ionizing ultraviolet radiation (about I erg cm(-2) sec(-1) at the earth) must polymerize methane at an appreciable rate under many likely conditions.

Distribution of Narrow-Width Magnetic Anomalies in Antarctica.

Data for aeromagnetic profiles obtained in Antarctica during the 1963-64 austral summer were used together with earlier results to construct a map showing the areal distribution of narrow-width magnetic anomalies. Numerous anomalies are associated with known volcanic mountains in western Antarctica. A large area of few anomalies is probably a result of an extension of the thick metasedimentary section observed in the Ellsworth Mountains. Portions of the Trans-Antarctic Mountains have associated anomalies which are probably caused by late Cenozoic volcanic rocks.

Site of Preference Energy and Selective Uptake of Transition-Metal Ions from a Magma.

Results of absorption spectra measurements on silicate glasses of various compositions indicate that ions of the first transition-metal series are present in tetrahedral and octahedral sites in silicate melts (glasses). The fractionation patterns observed for transition-metal ions between magmas and silicate minerals can be interpreted according to crystal field theory in terms of octahedral "site preference energies" of transition ions in crystal lattices.

Oxygen Isotopic Composition of Some Right-and Left-Coiled Foraminifera.

Right-and left-coiled foraminiferal species were collected from living and fossil faunas from different habitats. A difference in the oxygen isotopic composition of right-and left-coiled specimens was observed. Deposition of calcium carbonate by right-and left-coiled Foraminifera takes place, at least in the species measured, during non-coincident periods of the year.

Wheat Gibberellins.

Two "gibberellin-like" substances were present in malted wheat, compared to only one in sound, unmalted wheat. Alcoholic extracts of wheat malt fractionated by paper chromatography and bioassayed for gibberellin-like activity by three methods, indicated a new gibberellin in malted wheat. This component increased particularly in the embryo section of the sprouted wheat during the first 3 to 4 days of germination.

Pressure Distribution Measurements in Fixed-Anvil High-Pressure Cells.

Absorption spectra of selected microsections of materials with pressure-sensitive absorption bands mounted in diamond-anvil high-pressure cells were determined. The shift in the absorption peak, combined with data obtained at uniform pressure, permits calculation of the pressure of the microsection selected. Examples of a parabolic decrease in pressure from the center to the edge of the diamond anvil are demonstrated by contour diagrams.

Twilight Phenomena Caused by the Eruption of Agung Volcano.

Increase in twilight glow and in the dust stripes in the twilight arch have been observed from several places in the northern hemisphere from the fall of 1963 until now. Measurements of the twilight brightness indicate a considerable increase of dustiness in the stratosphere; this turbidity may be due to drifting ashes from the eruption of Agung volcano on Bali.

Night-Caught and Day-Caught Larvae of the California Sardine.

Some 70,000 larvae of the California sardine, collected from about 10,000 plankton hauls over the years 1950 to 1957, have been sorted by lengths and enumerated. The numbers of the day-caught larvae are very closely a numerical measure of the apparent mortality as indicated by the night-caught larvae. Over a considerable interval of size, the night-caught larvae appear to be representative of the entire larval population, but the day-caught larvae may represent a fraction that is a measure of the natural mortality of the population.

2-Aminoethylphosphonic Acid in Insoluble Protein of the Sea Anemone Metridium dianthus.

2-Aminoethylphosphonic acid has been isolated from a hydrolysate of insoluble proteinaceous material of Metridium dianthus in 1.1 percent yield. It appears to be incorporated in the protein structure; when trichloroacetic acid is added to partial hydrolysates, precipitates form from which this compound is released on complete hydrolysis. The phosphonic acid was also detected in hydrolysates of the 70-percent ethanol- and chloroform-soluble fractions of the sea anemone. The total amount isolated accounted for 0.99 percent of the dry weight of the animal.

Chlorophyll Content and Growth of Soybean Plants: Possible Interaction of Iron Availability and Day Length.

Data indicate a relationship between the availability of iron and the response of "Hawkeye" soybeans to day length.

When iron was present but not chelated the plants remained green in a 16-hour day but became chlorotic in a 9-hour day.

Daily Rhythm in the Susceptibility of an Insect to a Toxic Agent.

Adult boll weevils exhibited a daily rhythm in their susceptibility to standardized doses of the insecticide, methyl parathion. The mortality produced by the insecticide was intimately related to the time of day at which the toxicant was applied. The rhythm appeared to be photoperiodically entrained and, regardless of the length of day or "clock time-of-day of treatment," a period of greatest resistance always occurred at dawn and recurred at 6-hour intervals throughout the 24-hour cycle. The greatest difference in response occurred in a photoperiod having 10 hours of light per 24-hour cycle. Here, the same dose of methyl parathion killed approximately 10 percent of the weevils treated at dawn but almost 90 percent of those treated only 3 hours later.

Photoperiodic Reversibility of Diapause Induction in an Insect.

The diapause of the pink bollworm is under photoperiodic control. Diapause is prevented when the dark phases of the daily photoperiod are 8 to 10 hours in duration. If the dark period is extended to 12 hours, diapause is induced. Intercalation of 8- or 10-hour nights may reverse the diapause induction caused by exposure to photocycles having 12-hour dark phases. The 10-hour night was much more effective in reversing induction than the 8-hour night. The intensity of diapause, in part, appeared to be dependent on the previous photoperiodic experiences of the test animals.

Composition of Basalts from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.

Studies of volcanic rocks in dredge hauls from the submerged parts of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge suggest that it consists largely of tholeiitic basalt with low values of K, Ti, and P. In contrast, the volcanic islands which form the elevated caps on the Ridge are built of alkali basalt with high values of Ti, Fe(3+), P, Na, and K. This distinct correlation between the form of the volcanic structures, elevation above the sea floor, and composition suggests that the islands of alkali basalt are derived from a parent tholeiitic magma by differentiation in shallow reservoirs. The volume of low-potassium tholeiites along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and elsewhere in the oceans appears to be many times that of the alkali basalts exposed on oceanic islands. Tholeiitic basalts with about 0.2 K(2)O appear to be the primary and predominant magma erupted on the oceanic floor.

Geotropism: Its Orienting Force.

Seeds of Pisum sativum L. and other species were germinated and grown for five or more days on a continuously rotating vertical-axis turntable that developed a maximum centrifugal force of 1.79(g).

This is presented as confirmation of the hypothesis that the orienting force of geotropism of the higher plants is the inertial force of gravity.

Flowage Differentiation.

Flowage differentiation is an experimentally demonstrable process capable of causing crystal and chemical fractionation in nature. It is a mechanism for forming olivine-rich rocks in a vertical or steeply dipping position without prior concentration on a flat floor. It explains the field observation that the chilled margin of a mafic intrusion may not be a representative sample of the average composition of the parent magma. In contrast to previous hypotheses of origin for composite dikes, it causes fractionation during and as a result of a single movement of magma rather than by multiple injections.

Space Program: Results of Poll of AAAS Members.

A questionnaire prepared and sent by Science to 2000 randomly selected members of the AAAS has produced returns that indicate substantial disagreement with the aims and priorities of the national space program. The questionnaire drew 1134 returns within 3 weeks of mailing, including 548 on which the Ph.D. was listed as the highest degree held. A total of 139 respondents answered "yes" to the question: "Do you receive support directly or indirectly from the federal government in connection with space activities?" The questions and results are tabulated below according to percentage of total responses ("Total"), percentage of responses by Ph.D. holders ("Ph.D."), and percentage of responses by those who indicated a connection with space activities ("Space"). All percentages have been rounded off.

Faraday Rotation on Decametric Radio Emissions from Jupiter.

Some decametric radio emissions from Jupiter observed recently exhibit effects which are attributable to Faraday rotation within the earth's ionosphere. We present the evidence for the presence of Faraday rotation and discuss its origin. Identification of the magnetoionic mode in which the emission is generated at Jupiter appears possible, although near the limit of accuracy of our present observations. The emission seems to be generated in the extraordinary mode.

Mass Expulsion of Zooxanthellae from Jamaican Reef Communities after Hurricane Flora.

Very extensive bleaching of coral reef communities occurred after severe flood rains over eastern Jamaica. The loss of color was due to the mass expulsion of zooxanthellae from the tissues of Millepora, Scleractinia, Zoanthidea, and Actiniaria living in the shallow reef zones. The polyps of the bleached individuals continued to expand and feed in their normal fashion. It is believed that expulsion of the zooxanthellae was induced by contact with water of lowered osmotic pressure on the surface of the sea, rather than by sedimentation or fouling. Regeneration of the depleted zooxanthellar populations was very slow; many of the bleached colonies survived well despite the near total absence of zooxanthellae from their tissues for over 2 months.

Intracellular Transport Apparatus of Phloem Fibers.

Rotational streaming of cytoplasm occurs in the form of longicellular currents in immature and relatively mature fibers of bean stems. Plastids carried by these currents move continuously on their rotational course from one end of the cell to the other in relatively straight lines. A distance of approximately 2 millimeters, the average length of the fibers, is covered in about 3 minutes (3.6 cm per hour). The same type of streaming occurs in immature phloem fibers that develop within 24 hours after bean seeds are planted and before the plants appear above the soil surface. Rotational streaming also occurs in xylem fibers of bean stems and in cells which appear to be fibers in stems of young cucumber, tomato, sunflower, and flax.

Igneous Rocks of the East Pacific Rise: The alkali volcanic suite appear to be differentiated from a tholeiitic basalt extruded from the mantle.

The apical parts of large volcanoes along the East Pacific Rise (islands and seamounts) are encrusted with rocks of the alkali volcanic suite (alkali basalt, andesine- and oligoclase-andesite, and trachyte). In contrast, the more submerged parts of the Rise are largely composed of a tholeiitic basalt which has low concentrations of K, P, U, Th, Pb, and Ti. This tholeiitic basalt is either the predominant or the only magma generated in the earth's mantle under oceanic ridges and rises. It is at least 1000-fold more abundant than the alkali suite, which is probably derived from tholeiitic basalt by magmatic differentiation in and immediately below the larger volcanoes. Distinction of oceanic tholeiites from almost all continental tholeiites is possible on the simple basis of total potassium content, with the discontinuity at 0.3 to 0.5 percent K(2)O by weight. Oceanic tholeiites also are readily distinguished from some 19 out of 20 basalts of oceanic islands and seamount cappings by having less than 0.3 percent K(2)O by weight and more than 48 percent SiO(2). Deep drilling into oceanic volcanoes should, however, core basalts transitional between the oceanic tholeiites and the presumed derivative alkali basalts. The composition of the oceanic tholeiites suggests that the mantle under the East Pacific Rise contains less than 0.10 percent potassium oxide by weight; 0.1 part per million of uranium and 0.4 part of thorium; a potassium:rubidium ratio of about 1200 and a potassium: uranium ratio of about 10(4).

Infrared Spectroscopy and Catalysis Research: Infrared spectra of adsorbed molecules provide important information in the study of catalysis.

The examples discussed here represent only a small part of the published work relating to infrared spectra of adsorbed molecules. The publications in this field indicate that infrared spectroscopy is being used for surface chemistry research in about 50 laboratories throughout the world. This effort is mainly devoted to problems related to catalysis, and in this field infrared spectroscopy is the most widely used physical tool for surface chemistry studies. The general acceptance of infrared spectroscopy is primarily due to the fact that it provides information which is pertinent to the understanding of surface reactions on an atomic scale. During the last decade significant progress has also been made in the classical chemical techniques of catalysis study and in utilization of physical tools which depend on phenomena of magnetism, conductivity, low-energy electron diffraction, and electron emission. Probably the most important progress has been in the field of inorganic chemistry, where dramatic advances have been made in knowledge of metal coordination compounds. Such knowledge is vital to the understanding of catalysis on metal surfaces. I believe this progress has produced an attitude of sophisticated optimism among catalysis researchers with regard to eventual understanding of heterogeneous catalysis. This attitude is closely related to the realization that there is no "secret of catalysis" which places catalytic action beyond the limits of ordinary chemical knowledge (22). This view implies that the chemical aspects of heterogeneous catalysis are not unique and that the use of solid catalysts merely provides a highly effective exposure of catalytic atoms and facilitates separation of the products from the catalyst. Many capable catalysis researchers believe that studies of homogeneous catalysis provide the most direct route for the study of heterogeneous catalysis. Obviously homogeneous reactions catalyzed by compounds containing only one or two metal atoms do not leave room for effects associated with crystal parameters or with electronic band structure characteristic of the metallic state. At present, I believe, it is more reasonable to concede that these solid-state factors may play a role of secondary importance than to completely exclude them from consideration. The view that catalysis involves only conventional chemistry carried out under complicated conditions gives grounds for optimism, since it limits the boundaries of the problem. However, it also imposes a limitation on what might be expected from fundamental catalysis research. Most fundamental catalysis researchers do not rest their hopes on a single dramatic discovery which will make it possible to predict in detail the best catalyst for any specific reaction. The idea that catalysis researchers work with this goal in mind is as unrealistic as the idea that workers involved in practical catalysis development select constituents for catalysts by throwing darts at the periodic table. Although the fundamental catalysis researcher does not expect to advance ahead of general chemical knowledge, he does hope that he will not continue to lag behind. Infrared spectroscopy has provided a significant step toward closing the gap.

Carbonate Deposits and Paleoclimatic Implications in the Northeast Pacific Ocean.

A narrow carbonate band consisting predominantly of Globigerina-rich sediments is present in the deep-sea deposits of the northeast Pacific Ocean extending almost parallel to the coasts of Oregon and Washington. Five radiocarbon dates in the cores from this area suggest that the greatest concentration of Globigerina-rich sediments occurred 27,000 to 12,000 years ago. This time interval corresponds roughly to the Vashon (late Wisconsin) glacial times in the Puget Lowland. The results suggest higher carbonate sedimentation in the northeast Pacific during glacial stages.

Strontium Content and Variable Strontium-Chlorinity Relationship of Sargasso Sea Water.

Sargasso Sea water has a variable strontium-chlorinity relationship. This observation is contrary to the view that strontium in the ocean is in constant proportion to chlorinity. It is suggested that the increase in strontium concentration at 500 to 800 meters in Sargasso Sea water results from interaction between organic aggregates and the water.

Crystal Structure of Weddellite.

On the basis of x-ray analysis of its crystal structure, weddellite (the tetragonal crystal of calcium oxalate polyhydrate) has been determined to be a zeolitic dihydrate salt. The oxalate ion has at least the symmetry 2mm and possibly the symmetry mmm. The calcium ion is coordinated with eight oxygen atoms arranged in the form of a distorted cubic antiprism.

High-Pressure Polymorphs in the Silver Iodide Phase Diagram.

A good x-ray diffraction pattern has been obtained for the new phase of silver iodide stable in the vicinity of 3 kilobars at room temperature. A stability diagram of the six phases of silver iodide is presented to show the probable position of the narrow stability field of this phase. The x-ray diffraction data indicate that the cell symmetry of the new phase is probably orthorhombic.

Effect of Traces of Large Molecules Containing Nitrogen on Hydrogen Overvoltage.

Organic amines, present in very small concentrations (below 10(-6) M) in 0.1N H(2)SO(4), cause a significant increase in hydrogen overvoltage, the effect being stronger the higher the molecular weight. The increase could be accounted for by the usual site-blockage concept. In the case of egg albumin, a drastic increase of over 300 mv was observed at 12.5 ma/cm(2) for a concentration of only 0.01 part per million. A new mechanism is proposed in which the dielectric constant and hydrogen-ion activity are believed to be depressed in a region twice as thick as the usual transition region.

Enzymatic Mechanism for the Escape of Certain Moths from Their Cocoons.

An "escape hatch" from the cocoon of Antheraea pernyi is established by the hydrolytic action of a virtually pure proteinase which the moth first secretes and then dissolves by means of a solvent which maintains the enzyme at optimum pH. The proteinase is both synthesized and secreted by the maxillary galeae. The solvent derives from a pair of labial glands which have the form of long convoluted tubules lying alongside the foregut and opening to the exterior through a single aperture in the head.

Plant Damage Caused by Irradiation of Aldehydes.

The report that damage to petunia has been correlated with the presence of aldehydes in the atmosphere is discussed in relation to recent laboratory findings. Laboratory investigations have shown that irradiation of formaldehyde in air will not cause plant damage to the varieties of petunia, pinto bean, and tobacco wrapper used, even when nitrogen oxide is added to the system. Irradiation of propionaldehyde in air does cause damage to these plants. Addition of nitrogen oxide to the irradiated propionaldehyde-in-air system does not markedly increase damage.

Spore Discharge Mechanism in Basidiomycetes.

Spore discharge in basidiomycetes is effected primarily by the explosion of a small gas bubble in the area of the apiculus of the spore and by pressure of residual gas (probably carbon dioxide) that has accumulated between the inner wall and outer membrane of the spore apparatus. A somewhat similar mechanism of discharge has been discovered in an undescribed mycetozoan.

Infestation of the Copepod Acartia tonsa with the Stalked Ciliate Zoothamnium.

An entire population of the copepod Acartia tonsa in the Patuxent River, Maryland, was infested with a stalked protozoan of the genus Zoothamnium. Each copepod had 25 to 200 ciliates attached around the appendages. The infestation occurred at the time when Acartia tonsa was being replaced as the dominant copepod by Acartia clausi.

Pressure-Induced Trapping Phenomenon in Silver Iodide.

Observations of the optical properties and electrical conductivity of silver iodide at pressures between 2 and 4 kilobars are indicative of the formation of free silver (or silver and iodine) in this pressure range. On the basis of the sequence of events and the volume relations, this reaction could account for the smooth and reversible phase transformations of silver iodide in this pressure range. The phenomenon may be due to the trapping of an electron by the silver ion (in a thermally excited state) as a result of the distortion of the lattice under pressure.

High Pressure Polymorphism in Cesium.

A new polymorph of cesium, existing over the narrow pressure range from about 42.2 to 42.7 kilobars at room temperature, has been discovered. Its crystal structure is face-centered-cubic with a = 5.800 +/- 0.007 A at 42.5 kb and 27 degrees C. Cesium-II, which exists over the pressure range 23.7 to 42.2 kb, is also face-centered-cubic with a = 5.984 +/- 0.011 A at 41 kb and 27 degrees C. An improved resistance-pressure curve and x-ray compressibility measurements for Cs are also given.

Saturation Deficit of the Mesophyll Evaporating Surfaces in a Desert Halophyte.

The tensions developed in the internal evaporating leaf surfaces were estimated for a desert halophyte, Reaumuria hirtella, growing in its natural habitat. The method was based on the assumption that at zero transpiration the vapor pressure of the inner parts of the leaf was in equilibrium with that of the atmosphere, provided that stomatal resistance was constant during the measuring period. This could be ensured, since the measuring system controlled both the concentration of carbon dioxide and the atmospheric humidity, while measuring photosynthesis and transpiration simultaneously. Tension values of 180, 240, and 320 bars were recorded for three different Reaumuria hirtella plants.

Relative Contributions of Uranium, Thorium, and Potassium to Heat Production in the Earth.

Data from a wide variety of igneous rock types show that the ratio of potassium to uranium is approximately 1 X 10(4). This suggests that the value of K/U approximately 1 X 10(4) is characteristic of terrestrial materials and is distinct from the value of 8 X 10(4) found in chondrites. In a model earth with K/U approximately 10(4), uranium and thorium are the dominant sources of radioactive heat at the present time. This will permit the average terrestrial concentrations of uranium and thorium to be 2 to 4.7 times higher than that observed in chondrites. The resulting models of the terrestrial heat production will be considerably different from those for chondritic heat production because of the longer half-life of U(238) and Th(238) compared with K(40).

Negative Temperature Coefficient of Resistance in Bismuth I.

Measurements of the electrical resistance have been made on bismuth 1 between 15 and 35 kilobars at temperatures between 77.4 degrees and 120 degrees K. Above about 150 degrees K, the temperature coefficient of resistance is positive, as in a metal; below 150 degrees K, the coefficient becomes negative, as is characteristic of semiconductors. On the basis that bismuth is a semiconductor, the energy gap, calculated by the exponential resistance formula, is 0.006 ev at 15 kb with a steady rise to 0.018 ev at 35 kb. At higher pressures, bismuth I is transformed into a metallic modification with the normal temperature dependence of the resistance. The energy gap in bismuth I is not visible at room temperature because thermal excitation populates the conduction band and metallic behavior is the result. From available evidence the observed behavior is due to an energy gap rather than to a decrease in carrier mobility.

Explosive Welding with Nitroguanidine.

By using the explosive nitroguanidine, continuous welds can be made between similar and dissimilar metals. Since low detonation pressures are attainable, pressure transfer media are not required between the explosive and the metal surface. The need for either a space or an angle between the metals is eliminated, and very low atmospheric pressures are not required. Successful welds have been made between tantalum and 4140 steel, 3003H14 aluminum and 4140 steel, and 304 stainless steel and 3003H14 aluminum.

Pleistocene Wood Rat Middens and Climatic Change in Mohave Desert: A Record of Juniper Woodlands.

Leafy twigs and seeds of juniper are abundant in nine ancient Neotoma middens discovered in low, arid, desert ranges devoid of junipers, near Frenchman Flat, Nevada. Existing vegetation is creosote bush and other desert shrubs. Twelve radiocarbon dates suggest that the middens were deposited between 7800 to more than 40,000 years ago. Dominance of Utah juniper and absence of pinyon pine in most deposits indicates a local Pleistocene woodland climate more arid than the usual pinyon-juniper climate.

Pollen Wettability as a Factor in Washout by Raindrops.

Easily wettable pollen particles (contact angle theta < 90(o)) can be distinguished from poorly wettable particles (theta > 90(o)) by a simple laboratory test. Although some differences in degree of wettability were observed among the 15 pollens tested, all were wettable and most were strongly wettable. Grain wettability is not likely to suppress rain-scavenging efficiencies.

Pupil Size in Relation to Mental Activity during Simple Problem-Solving.

Changes in pupil size during the solving of simple multiplication problems can be used as a direct measure of mental activity.

These findings relate to recent Russian research on the pupillary reflex in connection with orienting and brain stimulation.

Periodic Phenomena Observed with Spherical Particles in Horizontal Pipes.

A thin layer of spherical particles resting on the bottom of a round pipe was observed to form into essentially equally spaced clumps or islands at fluid velocities only slightly greater than those required to initiate particle movement. This phenomenon appeared to be similar to dune formation in open channels since the ratio of the square of the stream velocity, U, and the product of the gravitational constant, g(L), and the island wavelength, lambda, was correlated by the same function of island height and velocity, particle diameter, and fluid depth regardless of whether the flow was through a closed conduit or an open channel.

Variation of Cesium in the Ocean.

Samples of sea water from several oceans and several depths were analyzed for natural cesium by flame photometry with precision of about 3.5 percent. The average of 16 assays of surface water from four oceans was 0.37 microgram per liter, somewhat less than the average previously reported. The average cesium concentration in samples taken between 500 and 1500 meters was about 14 percent higher than the surface average, suggesting that cesium may be transported downward by particulate material. Natural cesiumn is now somewhat easier to study in the ocean than radiocesium from fallout is, and information on one complements the other.

Transpiration: Its Effects on Plant Leaf Temperature.

A definite and significant temperature gradient exists over the area of a tomato leaflet and is apparently due to the variation in transpiration across the leaflet. Transpiration is most effective at low velocities of air movement, but when the velocity increases, convection becomes the dominant factor. Leaves in which the stomata are allowed to open naturally in response to light attain temperatures about 5 degrees C lower than leaves in which the stomata are forced to remain closed.

Spectroscopy of Solids in the Far-Infrared: Studies of superconductors, magnetic materials, and ferroelectrics in this spectral region are rewarding.

The far-infrared spectral region (10-100 cm(-1)) is a fruitful one for studies of solids. The experimental obstacle of weak sources has been partially overcome in recent years by the introduction of very sensitive bolometric radiation detectors cooled by liquid helium to temperatures near 1 degrees K. Used with a mercury arc source and a simple grating monochromator, these detectors have made work in a number of areas of solid-state physics possible. Important examples of such work are, (i) demonstration of the energy gap in superconductors and measurement of gap widths in various metals; (ii) observation of magnetic resonances in ordered magnetic materials, from which precise information about exchange fields and anisotropy energies can be obtained; and (iii) demonstration of the existence of a temperature-dependent low-frequency vibrational mode associated with the Curie-law dielectric constant in certain types of ferroelectric crystals.

After the intense Alaskan earthquake of 27 March 1964, unusual waves up to 6 feet (about 2 meters) in height occurred at about the time of arrival of seismic waves at many localities along the coasts of Louisiana and Texas. The parameters of local channels at the tide gauge in Freeport, Texas (the only instrument to record significant waves) yield seiche periods close to those of the seismic surface waves suggesting that the water waves were generated by and in resonance with the seismic waves.

Root Pressure in Conifers.

Exudation of sap was never observed to occur from stumps of detopped seedlings of loblolly pine or white spruce, but measurable exudation occurred from apical root segments, 4 to 8 centimeters long, which were removed from the root systems and observed individually. Fully suberized root segments of loblolly pine exuded as much or more sap than unsuberized roots. Exudation also occurred from detached sugar maple root segments, but not from stumps attached to entire root systems.

Explorations with the Hale Telescope.

The 200-inch telescope has performed much as Hale had hoped and predicted. Most of the programs he listed have made large advances. A very few have run into unforeseen difficulties.

Fluted Projectile Points: Their Age and Dispersion: Stratigraphically controlled radiocarbon dating provides new evidence on peopling of the New World.

The stratigraphic record shows Clovis projectile points to be restricted to sediments between 11,000 and 11,500 years old. Underlying deposits dating back 11,600 to 13,000 years are without evidence of human occupation. In the High Plains, overlying deposits dating back 10,000 to 11,000 years contain Folsom and Hell Gap artifacts and are without mammoth remains. The glacial history of Alaska, Canada, and the Great Lakes region indicates that, for the first time in at least 15,000 years, an ice-free, trans-Canadian corridor opened up approximately 12,000 years ago. Since Clovis points are distributed from coast to coast south of the Valders ice border, the abrupt appearance of Clovis artifacts in the stratigraphic record of the High Plains some 700 years later suggests that Clovis progenitors passed through Canada during Two Creeks time. If eastern fluted points (for example, Enterline) are older than Clovis points, the difference may be on the order of only a hundred or so years, not thousands. The change from Clovis points to Folsom points in the High Plains may be related to a marked decline in the mammoth population after 11,000 years ago, but whether or not man was a prime factor in the extinction of Pleistocene megafauna is a moot question. On the basis of new data and critical geological evaluation of dates obtained by the radiocarbon method a hypothesis has been offered to explain (i) the abrupt appearance of Clovis points in the stratigraphic record of the United States around 11,500 years ago, and (ii) the lack of a cultural continuum in the United States leading to fluted projectile points. Llano hunters, like the game they pursued, may have persisted longer in some areas of the continent (for example, Bull Brook) than in others, but if a Clovis site can be found for which good stratigraphic evidence supports a date earlier than the Two Creeks interstade, then correlation of this event to the opening of the trans-Canadian ice-free corridor is incorrect (see 41a). Such a misinterpretation of timing would not affect the explanation for the lack of Clovis progenitors in the United States. We must continue to look for an indigenous cultural continuum leading to Clovis points, but if such cannot be demonstrated in the conterminous United States, then it would appear that fluted projectile points were developed elsewhere. Clovis progenitors might best be sought in northern Alaska or the Mackenzie Valley. The interpretations offered here are based on new data and critical geological evaluation of dates previously obtained by the radiocarbon method. How valid these interpretations are can be ascertained only through careful scrutiny of all man-mammoth associations found in the future, to assure precise relating of dates, fossils, and artifacts to the stratigraphic framework. We must pay closer attention to stratigraphic detail if we are to make the fullest use of radiocarbon dating.

Vapor Pressure of Ice Containing D2O.

The vapor pressures of solid D(2)O and ice containing D2O in various amounts were measured with an oil manometer. The result gives the lowest vapor pressure for D(2)O ice ever obtained. The observed value for ice with different proportions of D2O and H(2)O agreed well with the values calculated on the assumption that the vapor pressure of HDO is the geometrical mean of those of H(2)O and D(2)O and that the equilibrium constant of isotopic exchange is 4. The fractionation factor of D between ice and vapor phases increases from 1.128 at 0 degrees C to 1.210 at -38 degrees C.

Noble Gases in Sea Water.

Concentrations of noble gases in samples of sea water obtained at depths to 3437 meters from a Pacific Ocean station were measured by mass spectrometry. An excess of helium, in relation to concentrations of the other noble gases, is attributed to influx of atoms of this gas from the sediments where it is produced by the natural radioactive decay of members of the uranium and thorium series. On the basis of a steady-state model, the escape of helium from the earth is calculated at 6.4 x 10(13) atoms per square centimeter per year.

Vibrational Excitation in Some Four-Center Transition States.

The rates of substitution of deuterium for hydrogen in homogeneous gas phase reactions between D(2) and HX (X = H, Cl, NH(2), or HS) were measured at high temperatures by single-pulse shock tube techniques. The magnitudes observed and their dependency on concentration indicate that the rates of exchange are much faster than would be attainable were the deuterium to dissociate and the D atoms to react with HX by atomic displacement to produce H + DX. Also, these rates were not limited by methathesis through four-center transition states generated by sufficiently energetic collisions between the principal reactants. The results are compatible with the assumption that the rates are controlled by the populations of D(2) in about its 6th vibrational energy level.

Coupling of Butyl Bromide on Hot Magnesium.

A report of the formation of octane when butyl bromide is passed over magnesium turnings at high temperatures should be amended. Such coupling does take place over pure magnesium at more moderate temperatures but yields 3-methylheptane and sec-butyl bromide in addition to octane. Sec-butyl bromide itself forms no coupling product under such conditions but admixed with butyl bromide markedly increases the 3-methyl-heptane:octane ratio in the product.

THE DEGENERATION AND REAPPEARANCE OF MITOCHONDRIA IN THE EGG CELLS OF A PLANT.

Details are given of the elimination of mitochondria which occurs during the first 1 to 2 hours of the life of the egg of the fern Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn. During this phase the only mitochondria present are swollen and appear degenerate, but subsequently the cytoplasm of the egg becomes filled with large mitochondria containing numerous villi. Accompanying the appearance of these mitochondria, many, if not all of which have a peculiar umbo-like form, is the production by the nucleus of conspicuous and complex evaginations. The umbo-mitochondria are believed to be new, and a mechanism is suggested by which they may be generated from the complex evaginations of the nucleus.

EVIDENCE For THE CYTOPLASMIC SYNTHESIS OF NUCLEAR HISTONE DURING SPERMIOGENESIS IN THE GRASSHOPPER CHORTOPHAGA VIRIDIFASCIATA (DE GEER).

Histone synthesis during spermiogenesis in the grasshopper Chortophaga viridifasciata was studied using autoradiographic and cytochemical methods. It was found that meiosis is followed by a cessation of RNA synthesis, an elimination of RNA from the nucleus, and, during the cytoplasmic sloughing accompanying the initial cytoplasmic elongation, a loss of most of the RNA from the cell. The initial phase of cell elongation results in a long spermatid headed by a spherical RNA-less nucleus bounded by a thin RNA-containing layer of cytoplasm. Subsequent nuclear elongation is accompanied by a replacement of the typical histones by others rich in arginine. This replacement is the result of synthesis of new protein. Incorporation of arginine is first seen to occur in the thin cytoplasmic layer surrounding the nucleus. This layer was shown by staining and electron microscopy to contain aggregations of ribosome-like particles. These observations support the conclusion that the histone is synthesized in association with the RNA granules in the cytoplasm, then migrates into the nucleus where it combines with the DNA.

EARLY STAGES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF PLASTID FINE STRUCTURE IN RED AND FAR-RED LIGHT.

Developmental changes in fine structure were studied in plastids of etiolated bean leaves during the time required for the protochlorophyllide-chlorophyllide transformation and the following lag phase prior to chlorophyll accumulation. In agreement with some other workers, two distinct stages of change in the fine structure of proplastids were found to occur upon illumination during this period. The first involves a dissociation of the previously fused units in the prolamellar bodies of the proplastids and occurs simultaneously with the protochlorophyllide-chlorophyllide conversion in light of 655 mmicro, but not of 682, 700, or 730 mmicro. The effect of the red light could not be reversed by a simultaneously supplied stronger far-red irradiation. The energy requirements for these structural changes parallel those for the pigment conversion. During the following step the vesicles which arose from the fused units of the prolamellar body were dispersed in rows through the stroma, and the prolamellar bodies themselves disappeared. For these changes to occur, higher light energies were required and the leaves had to be illuminated for longer periods. A red preillumination seemed to accelerate the development somewhat. The structural changes could be induced by light of 655 mmicro, but also, to a lesser degree, of 730 mmicro. No measurable additional chlorophyll accumulated during this period. Thus, the structural changes observed were independent of major changes in pigment content.

FINE STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN PROPLASTIDS DURING PHOTODESTRUCTION OF PIGMENTS.

Etiolated bean leaves supplied delta-amino-levulinic acid in the dark synthesize large amounts of protochlorophyllide which is not converted to chlorophyllide upon illumination of the leaves. The fine structure of the proplastids is not affected by the treatment. When leaves containing "inactive" protochlorophyllide are exposed to light of 700 ft-c for 3 hours, they lose practically all their green pigments. During this period large stacks of closed membrane structures are built up in the region of the prolamellar body. These lamellar structures remain even when no or only traces of pigment are left in the leaves. In untreated control leaves the pigment content remained constant during similar illumination and the structural changes in the plastids consisted of a rearrangement of the vesicles from the prolamellar bodies into strands dispersed through the stroma; lamellae and grana formation occurred later.

SUPPRESSION OF ANTIBODY SYNTHESIS AND PROLONGATION OF HOMOGRAFT SURVIVAL BY CHLORAMPHENICOL.

Chloramphenicol suppresses primary antibody synthesis in vivo without affecting the ability to develop a normal anamnestic response. Chloramphenicol also prolongs homograft survival in rabbits. The survival of homografts is related to the duration as well as to the amount of chloramphenicol administered. The mechanism of action of chloramphenicol in suppressing immune responses is correlated with its ability to inhibit protein synthesis in proliferating mammalian cells. These observations suggest that the inhibitory effect of chloramphenicol on protein synthesis may be applicable to mammalian cells in vivo as well as to cell-free systems and to intact mammalian cells in vivo.

EFFECT OF ACTINOMYCIN D ON RNA SYNTHESIS AND ANTIBODY FORMATION IN THE ANAMNESTIC RESPONSE IN VITRO.

Antibody synthesis in anamnestic lymphoid cells, measured by incorporation of leucine-C(14) into specific antibody, was inhibited at moderate concentrations of actinomycin D. This was accompanied by marked inhibition of synthesis of RNA as measured by incorporation of H(3)-cytidine monophosphate. However, at low concentrations of actinomycin D, antibody synthesis was unaffected or even increased while RNA synthesis continued to be inhibited. The results obtained suggest that messenger RNA for antibody synthesis, either because it is relatively stable or present in excess, does not become a limiting factor until its synthesis is maximally inhibited. Puromycin, an inhibitor of amino acid coupling, abolished antibody synthesis in low concentration. 6-Mercaptopurine had no effect on the synthesis of antibody or RNA even at high concentration. The data obtained support the view that antibody synthesis follows pathways similar to those utilized for the formation of other types of proteins.

THE ANTICOAGULANT AND ANTILYMPHOMA PROPERTIES OF ARSENIC AZOPROTEINS : I. ANTICOAGULANT EFFECTS OF ARSENIC AZOPROTEINS IN VIVO AND IN VITRO: COMPARISON OF ARSENICALS AS ANTICOAGULANTS AND AS ANTILYMPHOMA AGENTS: MOLECULAR STRUCTURE IN RELATION TO ANTICOAGULANT AND ANTILYMPHOMA PROPERTIES.

Experiments given in this paper have shown that 4-arsonophenylazoproteins possess marked anticoagulant activity both in vivo and in vitro. Mice and rabbits given moderate amounts of the arsenic azoprotein, for example, often bled to death from injuries that proved trivial in control animals, and their blood remained liquid during many hours' postmortem even when left in contact with transected tissues, fibrinolysis having no part in the outcome. So, too, the addition of minute amounts of 4-arsonophenylazoprotein to plasma procured from citrated rabbit or human blood greatly prolonged the time required for clotting after recalcification. Other arsenic-containing compounds,-for example, those in which arsenic See PDF for Structure was joined to amino acids or peptides through the azo linkage, or to proteins through couplings other than the azo linkage,-were largely devoid of anticoagulant and antilymphoma effects. The findings as a whole show clearly that the structural requirements for anticoagulant and antilymphoma effects are: (a) possession of negatively charged arsonic or arsinoso groups, (b) large molecular size (protein), and (c) linkage of arsenic-containing groups to protein through the azo bond. Two acidic azoproteins that were devoid of arsenic,-namely 4-carboxyphenylazoprotein and 4-sulfonophenylazoprotein,-were also found to have marked anticoagulant effects in vitro, but they had no inhibitory action against cells of Lymphoma 6C3HED in vivo, even when they were given to mice in maximum tolerated amounts. The essential part played by arsenic in the antilymphoma activity of arsenic azoproteins was further emphasized by the action of dimercaprol (BAL) in preventing the antilymphoma effects of 4-arsonophenylazoprotein on Lymphoma 6C3HED cells in vivo. In an associated paper the anticoagulant and antilymphoma effects of 4-arsonophenylazoproteins are studied further, and consideration is given to the ways in which these effects may be brought about.

THE ANTICOAGULANT AND ANTILYMPHOMA PROPERTIES OF ARSENIC AZOPROTEINS : II. COMBINATION OF ARSENIC AZOPROTEINS WITH FIBRINOGEN AND POLYMERIZING FIBRIN IN VITRO: ALTERATIONS IN MITOSIS OF LYMPHOMA 6C3HED CELLS INDUCED IN VIVO WITH ARSENIC AZOPROTEINS: DISCUSSION OF MEANS WHEREBY ARSENIC AZOPROTEINS MAY ACT UPON LYMPHOMA 6C3HED CELLS IN VIVO.

Experiments here given show that 4-arsonophenylazoproteins form complexes with fibrinogen which are resistant to the enzymic action of thrombin, coagulation being thus inhibited; also that arsenic azoproteins combine strongly with polymerizing fibrin, the reaction leading uniquely to acceleration of the process. Ordinary arsenicals have little or no effect on the proliferation of Lymphoma 6C3HED cells in vivo. 4-Arsonophenylazoproteins, by contrast, are strongly inhibitory, and they arrest the process of mitosis in metaphase, as does colchicine. Considered together with the observations of the preceding paper, the findings suggest that 4-arsonophenylazoproteins may exert their anticoagulant and antilymphoma effects by similar or related means: in the former instance, by combining in vitro with fibrinogen and polymerizing fibrin, thus altering the clotting process as mentioned above; and in the latter instance by combining, perhaps in a similar way, with polymerizing proteins in the mitotic spindle of proliferating Lymphoma 6C3HED cells, thus arresting mitosis. Further implications of the findings are discussed.

CONTRACTION IN GLYCERINATED MYOFIBRILS OF AN INSECT (ORTHOPTERA, ACRIDIDAE).

The A substance of glycerol-treated myofibrils of the femoral muscles of the locust Gastrimargus musicus (Fabr.), removed by a salt solution of high ionic strength, has the properties of actomyosin. A phase contrast study of these fibrils, contracted by the addition of ATP, has revealed that the A bands of most myofibrils shorten during contraction. Changes in density within the A band lead to the formation of C(m) and C(z) bands while I bands are still present. The A band region between the contraction bands is of much lower density than it is in the uncontracted fibril. During contraction in some fibrils the I bands disappeared and the A bands remained unchanged in length until contraction bands appeared. These results have been interpreted in terms of coiling and stretching of the thick filaments of the sarcomere.

Factors Affecting the Fluxes of Potassium and Chloride Ions in Nitella translucens.

A more complete study of ionic concentrations and fluxes in the giant internodal cells of Nitella translucens has been made. The vacuolar concentrations were 76 mM K and 170 mM Cl. The content of the chloroplast layer was 135 mmicromoles K/cm(2) and 215 mmicromoles Cl/cm(2); in a layer 9 micro thick these correspond to concentrations of 150 mM K and 240 mM Cl. Such a high level of chloride requires active transport of chloride into the cytoplasm, either at the plasmalemma or at the membranes bounding the cytoplasmic particles; it cannot be achieved by active transport of chloride only at the tonoplast. With concentrations of 0.1 mM K and 1.3 mM Cl outside, the fluxes into the cytoplasm had mean values of 1.0 to 1.4 micromicromoles K/cm(2)sec. and 2.1 to 2.8 micromicromoles Cl/cm(2)sec.; the corresponding fluxes from the cytoplasm to the vacuole were about 110 micromicromoles K/cm(2)sec. and 175 micromicromoles Clcm(2)sec. The transfer of both potassium and chloride to the vacuole under different conditions appeared to be correlated with the uptake of chloride into the cytoplasm. It is suggested that two separate processes are involved in the active accumulation of salts in the vacuole-an active uptake of chloride in the cytoplasm and a subsequent transfer of salt to the vacuole. It may be that the second process involves the formation of small vesicles in the cytoplasm and their subsequent discharge into the central vacuole.
