White-crested Laughingthrush
July 20, 2013
Redgannet
Birds
3 Comments
Apologies to amphibian-lovers everywhere. The scene that unfolded in Kent Ridge Park in Singapore was quite gruesome to watch. A pair of White-crested Laughingthrushes, Garrulax leucolophus, had found a frog in the moistness of the shade behind a line of trees.
They are omnivorous birds and I shouldn’t have been shocked by the enthusiastic way in which they acquired the meal, but there was something predatory in the way that they used their claws to keep it pinned at tarsus’s length while they fed from it.
This was not behaviour that I associated with Laughingthrushes and I found it a little disturbing.
Without the strong talons and bill of a hawk, they were unable to deliver a quick, killing bite. Instead they reared up high and stabbed viciously down onto the frog. This was repeated over and over, surely long after the frog was dead.
Even after it had been disembowelled, it was still subjected to repeated blows as though the birds were unused to preying on live animals and were unclear how much force was needed to subdue a little frog.
Best done on a soft surface.

Singapore White-crested Laughingthrush	Redgannet	Redgannet has been working for over 25 years as a crew member/flight attendant. The nom de blog Redgannet was adopted to add an air of mystery and to make himself more attractive to women. His father first whetted Redguga's appetite for all things natural by buying him his first pair of 7x35s and a copy of Thorburn's Birds. Having no mentor beyond an indulgent parent, he spent the first season hoping for an Egyptian Vulture at the bird table in his English garden. His most memorable birding moment is seeing an Egyptian Vulture with those same binoculars 26 years later. Redgannet (the blog) fledged in February 2009 and the 100th post was published as he was invited to become a beat writer for 10,000 Birds. Redgannet is married to Canon, but his heart and half of his house belongs to Helen and their son Joseph. He is looking forward to communicating with people who don't ask if he is searching for the "feathered variety" of bird.	Share This Article

Chris Cunningham	July 20, 2013 1:12:18 pm	Amphibians seem to be a favorite prey item of birds the world over. We love spending time in the swamps and marshes of the Texas Gulf Coast trying to get shots of waders taking amphibians and other prey. Some years (and in some spots) the water is alive with tadpoles and young frogs, and the waders seem to show an extra exuberance when they’re eating amphibians, rather than fish or aquatic insect larvae or crawfish–no spiny exoskeletons or fin spines to worry about getting caught in the gullet. On the Gulf Coast, amphibians are a favorite of Boat-tailed Grackles and Loggerhead Shrikes, also.
Everywhere we go birding, I’m always looking for amphibians: I think the number and diversity of amphibians present is a good proxy for the health of an ecosystem, especially now given the global amphibian crisis. Cheers.
Reply	Mike	July 21, 2013 4:01:57 pm	Great shots, Redgannet. I was sorry to miss these guys during my short trip to Singapore but look forward to catching up with them elsewhere. Guess I’ll leave my frogs at home.
Reply	Jochen	July 22, 2013 5:32:43 am	I am amazed how much their colouration resembles that of a shrike (a red-backed in particular).

Tiesto celebrates 'A Town Called Paradise' with Star-Studded Album Release Party

Posted Thursday, June 19th 2014 @ 3am by Nicole Mastrogiannis
Listen to Tiesto on iHeartRadio
Tiesto has finally released his fifth artist album A Town Called Paradise and to celebrate, he hosted a star-studded album release party at New York City's Terminal 5.
[Buy A Town Called Paradise on iTunes]
Terminal 5 was transformed to take Tiesto fans from New York City to A Town Called Paradise with the names of the album's songs projected on the wall as well as Vegas style signs and lights throughout the venue.
After an opening set from Danny Avila, Tiesto took the stage in a bright blue suit, similar to the one he wears on the A Town Called Paradise album cover, and launched into his set which featured performances from the vocalists featured on his new release. Joining Tiesto on stage during the album release party were Matthew Koma, Icona Pop, Ladyhawke, Quilla, Andreas Moe, and many more.
Fans not only heard all of Tiesto's new album, but also some crowd favorites from the legendary DJ. Tiesto is set to play the upcoming iHeartRadio Ultimate Pool Party in Miami at the end of June.
Check out some videos from the album release party below! "Red Lights" from All Night on Vimeo.

New Electronic License Plates Could Be Controlled By DMV, Law Enforcement Agencies
Tweet
Posted Wednesday, June 12th 2013 @ 12pm by Elizabeth Dorton
South Carolina is considering a formal switch from regular license plates to solar-powered plates that will be electronically controlled by the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles.
Compliance Innovations, the South Carolina-based company that wants to manufacture the plates and provide them to the state for less than $100 (the normal price is between $3 and $7), has provided a visual on their site. With one swipe of the mouse, a plain plate is emblazoned with bright red “EXPIRED.”
In an effort to make the South Carolinian roads safer, supporters say the goal is to better advertise ‘criminal-status’ to the authorities. The DMV could electronically announce the offense on the license plate, easily broadcasting it to passing police cars.
Compliance Innovation’s site demo displays examples such as “Amber Alert,” “Uninsured,” and “Suspended” in their visual diagram. The idea is that once an offense has been committed, the driver’s license has been suspended, or their insurance has not been paid, the DMV can send an instant announcement electronically.

Synopsis: Sandy often fantasizes about her mothers’ boyfriend Robert. She pleasures herself while she watches them make love. One evening Robert sees Sandy watching as they make love and the next day while she is in the bathroom he invites himself in. Things start to get hot and heavy when Sandy’s mother catches the two of them about to have sex. Ashamed Sandy runs away from home. She hitches a ride to New York where her sister Denise lives.
Neon Nights was made at the tell end of what is often referred as the Golden Age of Porn. It was a time when porno was shot on 35MM and not video likes modern porn is. The difference between classic and modern porn is most evident in how the films are structured. Classic porn film’s were about ¾ plot and ¼ hardcore sex and the sex was always part of the plot unlike today’s films which are almost non stop sex with little or no plot. There was a time in the late 1970’s when porn was almost accepted by the mainstream and many films even had red carpet premiers.
Neon Nights actually has a plot that is coherent and allows its characters to evolve. The plot especially near the very end tends to lean towards the surreal and multiple viewings are recommended since there is almost too much information of the screen to digest in one sitting.
The films editing is first rate especially in an early scene in which Sandy listens to her mother and Robert her mothers’ boyfriend making love. Sandy in the other room plays with herself while her mother and Robert go at it in the other room. The inter-cutting between these two rooms is pitch-perfect in execution. The films editor C. Davis Smith also worked as the Cinematographer and his lighting in most scenes is some of the best you will ever see in any porno film. Cecil Howard’s direction is excellent as he lays references from Fellini and Psycho though out the film. The Psycho homage is done in more of a tongue and check fashion then serious.
All the ladies in Neon Nights are drop dead gorgeous as they all have natural looking bodies and no boob jobs. Veronica Hart has some of the best dialog in the film as she spots off lines like “I’m going to make you sweat you are my private fucking machine right.” Lysa Thatcher does an amazing job playing the films lead Sandy. She is extremely convincing as her character moves through a dream like landscape. One of the films most memorable moments happens when Bonnie played by Kandi Barbour comes out of a pool with a wet t-shirt on. Kandi Barbour is also the cover girl on the DVD for Neon Nights. Veteran male performers Eric Edwards and Jamie Gillis both have solid performances that are in line with most the roles they play. My only complaint is that Jamie Gillis is barely in the film and his role is barely anything more then a cameo.
Overall Neon Nights is the closet any film has come to merging adult cinema with mainstream cinema.
The DVD:
Neon Nights is presented in its original full frame aspect ratio. The colors look vivid and nicely saturated. Black levels remain solid through out as there is an exceptional amount of detail in every frame. Grain is noticeable through out and outside of some minor print damage the print used for this transfer is nearly flawless. Overall this is the best looking transfer I have seen to date for a porn film from this classic era.
This release comes with two audio options Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby Digital mono mixes that are both in English. Both audio mixes are free of any hiss or distortion. The dialog is crisp and the music sounds evenly balanced with the rest of the mix. The difference between the Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby Digital mono audio mixes is so minimal that they sound almost identical.
Extras for this release are spread across two DVD’s.
Extras for the first disc include two trailers one for the XXX version of Neon Nights and one for the Cable T.V. Version of the film. Other extras include nearly thirty six minutes of outtakes form the film. They include various angles and set ups not used in the final film as well as a few moments not in the final cut. Cecil Howard provides audio commentary about the actors and what is going on in each scene. Rounding out the extras for disc one is an audio commentary with Cecil Howard who is joined by Casey Scott who helps moderate the discussion. This audio commentary is full of insight as Cecil Howard remembers in vivid detail behind the scenes and in front of the camera stories about Neon Nights.
Extras on disc two include an extensive photo gallery that includes numerous candid shots and this extra plays like a featurette and it runs about six minutes in length. There is also another photo gallery of box art for the various films that Cecil Howard has worked on and music from the film plays in the background like a featurette. Other extras include a trailer for Babylon Pink as well as trailers for Porno Holocaust, Lady Emanuelle, Erotic Nights of the Living Dead and Emanuelle and the Last Cannibals. The main extras include on this second disc are four interviews that run in between thirty and twenty minutes each in length. The first three interviews with Jamie Gillis, Veronica Hart and Eric Edwards all follow the same pattern as they give a extensive overview of each performers careers as the remember vividly the sordid details from their past. The four and final interview is with the films cinema photographer C. Davis Smith. This interview is the most technical of the four. The best interview of the four included is the one with Jamie Gillis whose off screen persona closely resembles the onscreen mayhem he often created with his unique performances. The interviews with the various cast and crew are some of the best extras I have ever seen on any DVD. Rounding out the extras for the second disc is the cable T.V. version of Neon Nights which runs about twenty nine minutes shorter then the XXX version. The T.V. version is a nice addition but since it removes all the hardcore action it is almost unwatchable. The quality of transfer for the T.V. version of Neon Nights is a little ruff around the edge and it looks nowhere near as good as the XXX version does.
Media Blasters/Command Video’s Neon Nights DVD is hands the most impressive adult cinema release ever produced with its wealth of informative extras and solid audio/video presentation, highly recommended.

Both Republicans and Democrats—would defy any new laws that would take away their guns.
Posted by Tara on January 27, 2013 at 1:47am in Guns and Tactics
Back to Guns and Tactics Discussions
It’s safe to say Feinstein, Obama and the rest of the gun control gang face an uphill battle when it comes to limiting any Second Amendment rights. According to a Fox News poll, most Americans—both Republicans and Democrats—would defy any new laws that would take away their guns.
But on to Question 47, addressed to those with a gun in their home: "If the government passed a law to take your guns, would you give up your guns or defy the law and keep your guns?"
The response: 65 percent reported they would "defy the law." That incudes 70 percent of Republicans, 68 percent of conservatives, 52 percent of Democrats and 59 percent of liberals.

Settlement Reached in Salina Contamination Cleanup
By KMAN Staff - December 14, 2012 Share on Facebook
Tweet on Twitter
tweet SALINA, Kan. (AP) Salina officials and the federal government have reached a financial settlement to cover the cost of cleaning up contaminated groundwater and soil at a former Air Force base.
Officials announced Thursday that the federal government will pay 90 percent of an estimated $9.3 million to clean up the industrial solvent TCE at the former Schilling Air Force Base. The city of Salina will pay the remaining 10 percent.
KSAL reports the federal share is about $8.4 million and the local share is $936,000.
The deal must be approved by the Salina City Commission, the Salina School District, the Salina Airport Authority and Kansas State University, as well as the district court.
TCE was once used as an industrial solvent but has been classified as a human carcinogen.

El 24 de mayo Batalla de Pichincha Resumen La Batalla del 24 de Mayo. LA BATALLA DE PICHINCHA 24 de Mayo de 1822 Fue la batalla de la liberación del yugo español. Un momento histórico para la vida repúblicana del Ecuador. La historia señala al mariscal Antonio José de Sucre como el gran gestor de la batalla del Pichincha que dió paso a un proceso de independencia que se concretaría luego el 10 de agosto Independencia del Ecuador.
Luego de la liberación de Guayaquil, el 9 de octubre de 1820, el país entra en una profunda refundación de su identidad y tras dos intentos fallidos por liberarse de la opresión, se produce la gran batalla en las faldas del volcán Pichincha, de ahi que la historia recuerda ese episodio como la Batalla del Pichincha.
Fue en el año 1822, donde Sucre decide hacerle frente a las tropas españolas con 1.700 hombres que con el paso de los días se convirtieron en 3.000 gracias a San Martín.
El gran día estaba por llegar, fue la madrugada del 23 de mayo cuando las tropas se dirigen silenciosamente al Pichincha para planificar lo que sería la batalla de la libertad y el triunfo.
Después de percances y horas de espera, el 24 de mayo se produce la batalla bajo un sol resplandeciente. Pese a las bajas, los soldados victoriosos fueron subiendo la cima del volcán. Una vez en la cima exlamaron victoria y con ello se consagrò una de los dìas más recordados para la historia del Ecuador .
El 24 de mayo es considerada una fecha cívica de los héroes que ofrecieron sus vidas por la libertad. Con la Batalla del Pichincha, se selló la independencia política del Ecuador que marcó el comienzo de la vida republicana y autónoma del Ecuador.
El 25 de mayo, Sucre entró con su ejercito a Quito donde anunció la rendición de las tropas españolas establecidad en el territorio que el gobierno de Colombia llamada "Departamento de Quito", al considerarlo como parte integral de la República de Colombia desde su creación, el 17 de diciembre de 1819.

to Алекс тупо это “офицеры 2″ после 4 серии, а наивно, а что тут наивно? Такое впечатление, что люди используют слова не зная их значения.

сюжет не плохой, но игра актёров и съёмки оставляют желать лучшего… если внимательно смотреть, опплюёшся, полно киноляпов и режущих слух реплик и ругательств! но девушкам очень нравится, что характерно… Malet пишет

Повторюсь, посравнению с “офицеры 2″ и “группа зета” этот фильм просто шедевр.

13 Март 2009 @ 22:09
А никто не считал, случайно, сколько раз в фильме используются слова Бандиты и Десантники ))? У автора сценария явно проблемы с запасом слов… Я честно сериал до конца досмотрела, но впечатление на слабенькую троечку. Особенно убило то, как Десантники умело маскируются в костюмах и гриме дебилов. Дааа, в таком виде точно никто ничего не заподозрит:)))!!!

Lunchbox, Dometop, Disney, Aladdin
$120.00
Lunchboxes, Metal Lunchbox, Disney School Bus is a great dometop, metal box with wonderful graphics. It has a thermos from the period, but is not the correct thermos. The box is in nice condition with a little edgewear and a couple of ding and bangs but really nice for the age as it was produced by Aladdin in 1961-73 and it is so much harder to find the dome top metal boxes. View all of the pictures as it is just as found. $120.00

Two Sides of the Ocean: My First Family in the 1940 US Census
Monday, April 2, 2012
My First Family in the 1940 US Census
Here it is - April 2, 2012 and the day of the launch of the 1940 US Census. Like so many other genealogists I have been eagerly waiting for this day and planning my attack method. I will admit that I was pretty confident, though, that the much awaited census release would cause a major snafu with the National Archives and Records Administration and I was certainly correct.
Try as I might from early this morning until about 4 pm I was unable to gain access to any Michigan census records that I was hoping to find. I had planned to search first for my mother in this census as she was 14 at the time the census was taken. I have her on the 1930 census as a 4 year old child and that showed her family living in the "country" on the family farm on Cleveland Avenue in St. Joseph, Michigan which is where my mother was born. Between 1925 and 1939 when my mother began high school, however, the family had moved 5 times into various rental homes in the city proper of St. Joseph and she could not recall exactly WHICH home they lived at in 1940. They also traditionally had an open door policy for relatives that were in need of a home from time to time and I was interested in seeing if her grandfather was listed as living with the family in 1940. Despite my best efforts today, nothing was working on NARA.
Other sites were offering the 1940 census but the pickings were limited to a few states that did not involve my ancestors. But when I saw on Ancestry that they did have the 1940 Indiana census records I had a thought. My mother's aunt and family had lived in South Bend, IN so I decided to go in search of their record.
First to the 1930 census I went in search of the family of Joseph and Rose (Kijak) Baker. I found them easily (indexed naturally) along with their young daughter Rose M. An interesting find was the neighbors on each side of them who were Rose's half sister and family on one side - Joseph and Mary Emma (Banner) Linehan and Rose's half brother and family on the other side - Frank and Bernice Banner along with two more half brother's Anthony and James Banner. Here are these three families in the 1930 Indiana US Census:
The source for this image from Ancestry.com is as follows:
Ancestry.com. 1930 United States Federal Census [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations Inc, 2002. Original data: United States of America, Bureau of the Census. Fifteenth Census of the United States, 1930. Washington, D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, 1930. T626, 2,667 rolls.
From this census I was able to ascertain the Enumeration District which was 71-3 in Clay Township, South Bend, Indiana and that took me back to Ancestry to look for these families in the 1940 Census. Of course with no index yet this would be a bit more challenging. The census for ED 71-3 consisted of 62 pages and I began scrolling and scrolling. I will say that the quality of the film was excellent and I continued to scroll, scroll, and scroll. My mother was standing over my shoulder watching me as she was caught up in the excitement of this event. As the scrolling continued I began to despair thinking that these 3 families probably moved in the previous 10 years. Finally my mother gave up at about page 50 and went back to her TV watching.
Not one to quit I continued. Perhaps I should have started at the end and went backwards OR remember the phrase "and the last shall be first" because it was on page 62, the very last page of this ED, that I found Joseph and Rose (Kijak) Baker along with daughter Rose M as can be seen here:
The source for this image from Ancestry.com is as follows:
Ancestry.com. 1940 United States Federal Census [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2012. Original data: United States of America, Bureau of the Census. Sixteenth Census of the United States, 1940. Washington, D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, 1940. T627, 4,643 rolls.
This was an interesting census for me in that it showed Rose having had 7 years of education and I will be curious to see if her older brother, my grandfather, Joseph Kijak, had a similar amount of education. As an added bonus, the supplementary census questions that were selected for some to answer were asked of my great aunt Rose and these correctly showed that her parents were both born in Poland, that Polish was the language spoken in her home when she was growing up and that she had given birth to ZERO children - the above daughter, Rose M, was adopted as my mother had always told me.
I did not find in this ED the other two families of Rose's half siblings but I am sure they are somewhere else in the South Bend area as they remained there their entire lives. In any event I am pleased and can say that this family is the FIRST for me for the 1940 US census.

About Me

Intent of this Blog
This is an ongoing history of my German and Polish ancestors, their lives and the factors that caused them to "cross the ocean" to create new lives in America!
Why My Family History?
When did my quest for searching my ancestry begin? The earliest I can remember is when my paternal grandmother gave me a black onyx ring with a tiny diamond in the center. She told me that the diamond had come from one of the three tiny diamonds in her wedding pendant from 1917. The necklace had been broken over the years and she subsequently took the 3 diamonds out and had them made into rings. I remember quizzing her on her parents and grandparents and there was no turning back. Now many years later I am still searching and learning; once bitten by the genealogy bug there is no stopping. And the search goes on and on............
Explanation of Blog Header
The header (above) that appears on this blog was created after much deliberation as to how to adequately depict the focus and theme of "Two Sides of the Ocean".With this header, you will see images of a lighthouse and harbor area which is reminiscent of the lighthouse in southwest Michigan where two lines of my family immigrated to. There are two photos included from Germany including one showing the village of Schwarzenbach by Nürnberg, Bavaria, Germany where my Bauer family originated and a photo of the Evangelical Church of Gross Tuchen, Bütow, Pommern where my Kolberg and Kramp families originated.The 4 photos in the center are of my 4 great-grandmothers, namely Amelia (Schluessler) Wellhausen, Mary (Rubis) Kijak, Bertha (Kramp) Kolberg and Juliane (Feucht) Schulte. Two of these great-grandmothers were born on "this" side of the ocean while the other two were born on the "other" side of the ocean.

New Year's Resolutions - Do you?
Choices Yes. It's a ritual. I write them down and stick to them. New Year's Day is always a new start. Usually. I try to start the year with clear goals and a plan. I'm pretty good about sticking to the plan. Occasionally. Every few years I get motivated and make a list in January, but they usually fade. Not so much. I always MEAN to make resolutions with the New Year, and I have them in my head, but that's about it. Never. Goal setting and completion take place year round. The start of the year is no different than any other day. Older pollsResults

I didn’t understand the big deal with the undead until my friend Becky and I happened to be eating Indian food near the 16th Street Mall during one of Denver’s first zombie crawls. The phenomenon came alive for me when I witnessed zombies on the mall ride, waiting to amble across the street and even pretending to attack secretly-consenting pedestrians. In its essence, it was a performance art-based costume party—a pre-Halloween opportunity to role play in the streets. I was so down.If what’s left of my memory serves me correctly, the only zombie flick I’d seen up to that point was my buddy Eric Bakst’s short film Working Stiff (zombie comedies like Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland have entertained me since). Michael Jackson became my point of entry. I was a little too young to appreciate Thriller when it was first released, but singing, dancing zombies were right up my alley. I’d already scored red pleather pants at a thrift store some years back, and Team EZ performers like myself had been expected to purchase zombie contacts for LA’s Electric Daisy Carnival that June. When I stumbled across a red leather jacket at Buffalo Exchange that August, there was no turning back. All I needed to complete the ensemble was a Jheri curl wig and some makeup.In its seven year lifespan (living dead-span?), Denver’s Zombie Crawl has become arguably the largest on Earth (Seattle is apparently our only competition). This year’s reanimation is set to go down Saturday, October 20 at Skyline Park. Casselmans hosts the official after-party featuring headliner Celldweller.

Birdheart
21 x 28 cmFound black & white photograph, orange thread, found bird picture from a bird book//Ever since I was a child we had parrots as our family pets. The most wonderful parrot we ever had was Sammy. Initially named Samuel Gertler, but then, later on we found out Samuel was actually Samantha. (That's another story though.)She was a Yellow - Napped Amazon.She was the best parrot ever.We got her when I was 11 years old, and she was 3 months old. After 3 days she already said her first word - "hello". It was out of control from there on out. Yellow Napes are the best talkers along side African Greys. Amazons have the intellect of a 2 year old child - and that is no joke. Not only could she speak incredibly well, but she could also word associate with various situations. If my mom was coming home and she could hear my mom's car - she would say "Hi Mom". If it was my dad's car, then the obvious (of course) "Hi Dad". It was incredible. I taught her to turn her head, look up in the sky and say "What's the birdie doing up there?". That was one phrase of many, many other phrases that she could say. Here is a partial list of her vocabulary:Hi babyWhatcha you doing?How are you?Here kitty kittyMy friendMy babyRenee (my sister's name)Lisa (my mom's name)AprilComo se llama?I hate youYou stupid idiotand the best word of all:birdheart (she made that one up on her own)The list goes on...and on...and on...So this work is an homage to Sam.She was remarkable.I am welling up just thinking about her even though she passed away about 5 years ago (we had her for 23 years), and she has been sorely missed.

my dad had a friend with a parrot, when the cat sat below his cage, he'd go "whoak! Feed the cat! Feed the cat!"I love it when you write stories with your pieces.

sports Young Firpo, the Best Light Heavywieght to Never Win a Title

Guido Bardelli also known as Young Firpo, one of the world’s greatest light heavyweights, campaigned from 1924 – 1937, an era considered by many boxing historians to be the greatest era in the history of boxing. Born in Barre, Vermont in 1907, his family moved to northern Idaho eventually settling in the mountainous mining town of Burke, Idaho, where Guido was introduced to the world of boxing in 1924 at the age of 17 as “Young Firpo.”
Young Firpo’s reputation as a quick-silvered reflex knockout artist in the Pacific Northwest grew, as knockout followed knockout, until January of 1930 when he was signed to fight in Portland, Oregon, against Oaklander Ray Pelky. Pelky entered the contests as a prohibitive favorite. Firpo revealed his wares by viciously kayoing Pelky in 2 rounds, Pelky declaring he had never been hit so hard in his life after being revived nearly 2 hours later. Pelky also stated, “He is a murderous puncher. He’ll knock any man up to 200 pounds. I was a fool to take the match.” Already well known in the Coeur d’Alene Mining District and Pacific Coast because of a rugged viciousness that many sport’s writers of the era compared to the greatest fighters they had every seen, after disposing of Pelky in Portland, Portland claimed the Idaho slugger as its own. Thereafter, Firpo went on to fight in Portland 24 times during a 7 year period while also engaging in major fights throughout all the west including Oregon, Colorado, California, Montana, Washington, and Idaho. In the early part of his career, he became embroiled in disputes with a series of contending individuals who sought to become his manager. Firpo came to disdain managers and refused to sign contracts with anyone who sought to be his manager.
Mel Epstein, veteran fight manager-trainer, also sought in vain to become Firpo’s manager from the late 1920’s, when Epstein first laid eyes on Firpo in Butte, Montana, through the duration of Firpo’s ring career. Although Firpo refused to engage Epstein as a fight manager, Firpo did come to trust Mel and engaged him as a trainer. Indeed, it was Mel Epstein who was in Firpo’s corner, as a trainer and quasi-manager, for the majority of the major fights in which Firpo was involved from 1930 onward including Firpo’s epic Portland contests with Leo Lomski, Wesley “KO” Ketchell, George Manley, Tiger Jack Fox, and John Henry Lewis. In a 1970’s interview, Mel Epstein was asked, “How good a fighter was Firpo, Mel?” In a voice loaded with excitement, Epstein answered the question over the course of more than 30 minutes, stating in part that “Young Firpo was unbeatable; he was practically unbeatable until he had that damn car wreck. He was colorful! Every fight was filled action. The fans liked the action. Excitement and action…. He should have been the light heavyweight champion of the world. Ask him. He knows it.” When asked during the interview how Epstein envisioned the outcome of a fight between Young Firpo and then reigning light heavyweight champion Victor Galindez, Epstein replied, “Ahh … Firp woulda knocked him out. He’d knock all of em [light heavyweights] out. He was a slugger and nobody’s fool in there. Firp was like lightning you know. He was like an eel, elusive, slippery. You couldn’t tie him up to keep him off. He had too much for these guys.”
In another 1970’s informal Los Angeles interview, former welterweight champion of the world Jimmy McClarnin was asked by a Mel Epstein managed fighter Rick Farris, who had overheard McClarnin and Los Angeles Boxing Promoter George Parnasus talking about Young Firpo, “Just how good was this Young Firpo?” McClarnin responded without hesitation, “Oh, let me just tell you that Young Firpo was the greatest fighter I ever saw.” During that same interview both McClarnin and George Parnasus volunteered to an awe struck young and impressionable Rick Farris, who later became a boxing historian and World Boxing Hall of Fame Director, which “Young Firpo hit harder than either Bob Foster or Archie Moore. Firpo would have knocked them out.”
Sport’s writer L. H. Gregory, who penned Greg’s Gossip for the Portland Oregonian for over 50 years, in a 1971 column wrote that Young Firpo was the most “exciting fighter” he ever saw in a writing career which encompassed over 50 years of watching fights. Gregory wrote that “Young Firpo was unforgettable…. His aggressive, go-get-em-style was spectacular…. We have never seen more active fighting once in the ring. He started them in motion from the first bell and never let up while the fight lasted…. From opening bell he’d move in on an opponent with the least possible ‘feeling out’ of experimental jabs, both arms and hands flailing as if on half-circular hinges —- bang, bang, bang, bang, almost exactly alternating left, right, left, right in a continuous tattoo. We can still see those explosive alternating gloves breaking through against the opponent’s face and upper body.” Northern Idaho writer Maidell Clements who witnessed Firpo’s ring exploits wrote in 1981: “When the bell rang, Firpo would charge across the ring and throw punches from all angels. Many a fighter wouldn’t know what hit them till their heads began to clear in the dressing room.”
Another Portland boxing writer, Billy Steppe, himself a prolific writer and keen observer of the boxing scene for over 70 years on the Pacific Coast, had suffered a stroke prior to his being interviewed in the 1970’s and was unable to speak. However, when asked to name the greatest fighter he ever saw, Steppe simply wrote, “Young Firpo.” Young Firpo’s futile and turning point in his march toward the light heavyweight championship suffered its severest blow when, in the spring of 1934, while traveling to Butte, Montana, to fight Gorilla Jones, Firpo was involved in a motor vehicle accident and sustained serious injuries which landed him in the hospital for weeks. It was thought that the injuries brought about the end of his fight career. Firpo would not fight again until August of 1934, when he defended his Pacific Coast Light Heavyweight Championship in a “tune-up” match against the onslaught of hard punching knockout artist Tiger Jack Fox, the same Fox who Jersey Joe Walcott, in 1974, called the greatest fighter Walcott ever fought not excluding Joe Louis, Rocky Marciano, and Ezzard Charles. Walcott was knocked out by Fox and beaten in 10 rounds in a second fight with Fox. Fox was favored to defeat Firpo because Fox had been active throughout the 1934 fight year while he recuperated and Fox had run up a string of knockouts while Firpo was totally inactive and had not engaged in a single fight in 1934.
Despite the odds, Firpo defeated Fox in a Portland brutal encounter. Firpo floored Fox in the sixth round after Firpo, himself, had been floored by Fox in the same round. Seemingly, it appeared that Firpo had recovered from the injuries sustained in the automobile accident but, as Epstein stated, such was not the case. One month later, on September 20, 1934, John Henry Lewis, claiming that he was the uncrowned light heavyweight champion of the world following the NBA’s stripping Maxie Rosenbloom of the title, sought to divest Young Firpo of the Pacific Coast Light Heavyweight title in yet another Portland fight. Lewis was being touted as the “uncrowned light heavyweight champion” because he had defeated titleholder Maxie Rosenbloom in two non-title affairs flooring Rosenbloom 7 times in the process. In another vicious slugfest taking place on September 20, 1934, Lewis escaped with a draw. Every major newspaper writer in attendance covering the fight, including Billy Steppe, H.L. Gregory, Don McCloud, and George Bertz, thought that Firpo won the fight. Lewis was on the verge of being knocked out in both the 7th and 8th rounds. Referee Tom Louttit declared the contest a draw. Firpo retained his Coast title. However, bedlam ensued with pronounced booing between 5 and 10 minutes and things were thrown into the ring including a knife before order was restored.
As an aftermath, Lewis eventually went on to win the title by defeating Bob Olin and refused to fight Firpo in a rematch with the World’s Light Heavyweight Championship on the line despite repeated challenges having been made from Firpo. From 1930 through 1937, Young Firpo challenged in vain for a shot at the light heavyweight title, held chronologically during this period by Maxie Rosenbloom, Bob Olin, and John Henry Lewis. Firpo telegraphed a Spokane promoter “Will fight Fox, Lewis, Olin, or Rosenbloom. I fear no man.” In 1933, Rosenbloom and Firpo were signed to fight a championship match thought to be the first championship match ever held in Portland but a gate dispute led to cancellation of the fight. When the fight was initially signed, coast writers gave Firpo a better than even chance of beating Rosenbloom because of his speed and punching prowess. After the cancellation, Firpo sought in vain to again get Rosenbloom’s signature on a contract. During an interview, Firpo told a boxing writer, “With the championship on the line, I’ll fight Rosenbloom for nothing.” Rosenbloom, who seemingly ducked no fighter, would not sign to defend his title against Firpo.
Retiring in 1937, Firpo maintained that between 1924 – 1937, he engaged in 134 fights, scored 79 knockouts, suffered 15 losses (some of which he questioned) and had 4 draws. BoxRec, a computerized database of boxing data, maintains that Young Firpo’s record consists of 93 fights, 74 victories, 45 knockouts, 15 losses, and 4 draws. Guido Bardelli married the lovely Mary Widitz from Roundup, Montana, in 1934 and their marriage produced three children, Cleo Marie Clizer, Frederick K. Bardelli, and John Ambrose Bardelli. Young Firpo passed away in 1984.
Young Firpo is being inducted in World Boxing Hall Of Fame on November 15, 2008 at the Banquet of Champions at LAX Marriott, located at 5855 West Century Boulevard, Los Angeles, California 90045. Social hour will begin at 6:00 pm, followed by dinner and induction ceremony at 8:00 pm.

Hips 44 to 42 inches. Bodyfat 27% to 19%Details:I followed the SCD pretty closely. For breakfast I have egg whites, beans and some vegetable. I eat a small lunch, nice sized dinner, and drink about 3 liters of water per day. I have coffee with either cinnamon or stevia, typically 24-30 OZ. I drink tea with dinner, with lemon. I am doing kettle bell swings 3x per week. I do weight training Monday and Friday. I have a muscle imbalance as I worked the last ten years behind a computer, so if anyone has hints or tips to get rid of that I would Appreciate it.Great post!Bury this blog postReply to post3The Best AnswerLauraCox posted the best reply:Rock on, great to see you had excellent results even with stevia. I've been a fan for years now and don't get sugar cravings anymore. As for muscle imbalance, I've read that you'll always be stronger on your dominant arm, but you can try building up your weaker side with heavier weights. I also work behind a computer all day and get nasty back knots. I find that exercising regularly helped my desk posture so that I lean forward less.You taught me something!Bury this replyjodyalbritton commented Oct 15th 2011: My stevia use is very minimal. I use cinnamon for my first cup of coffee, and maybe one packet of truvia in the second. I do not use anything other than lemon in my tea. Further I drink 3.0+ liters of water of the course of a day. Sometimes as many as 12-14 16oz water bottles.My dad is drinking mostly tea with stevia and his weight loss has not been as rapid as mine, and he has seen plateau periods over the last thirty days.

Congrats!You taught me something!Bury this reply0Maria Rider answered: Congrats, Jody!That is a definitely a visible difference between when you started and how you look now. I can tell the kettlebells are having their effect on your posture too! Nevermind your disappearing gut. Way to go! Keep it up!You taught me something!Bury this replyjodyalbritton commented Oct 14th 2011: For sure on the kettlebells, It's like I gained a 1/4 inch in height over the last thirty days. I am constantly amazed that doing a little can change a lot. Maria Rider commented Oct 15th 2011: Wow, it's probably all the slouching computer workers get after being in the chair all hours. Kettlebells are wonderful for fixing posture. Way to go! grotts commented Oct 15th 2011: Very encouraging. I'm on day eleven and your results are for sure inspiring. Please keep it up!!0kiki answered: I'm new to the forum and your results give me encouragement.

WATCH: BMW Tests Its Armored SUV By Shooting It With A Bunch Of Guns

Posted Thursday, August 28th 2014 @ 10am by Giuseppe Macri
Listen to The Man Cave on iHeartRadio
BMW unveiled a new bulletproof version of its X5 SUV at the Moscow International Auto Salon this week, which press photos prove can withstand some serious punishment.
The new X5 Security Plus can reportedly take direct fire from an AK-47 assault rifle from 33 feet away thanks to its reinforced shatterproof security glass, and an ”armored passenger cell” made of special steel built into the frame of the SUV.
“The risk of armed violence — in particular, attack with automatic weapons like the AK-47 — is a fact of everyday life for certain customers,” BMW said of its security vehicles line, according to The Wall Street Journal.
The X5 also features an eight-cylinder turbo-charged 450-horsepower engine and all-wheel-drive for quick getaways on and off-road, all of which — when combined — will likely cost potential customers around $180,000 or more.

Posted: Tue Oct 27, 2009 1:03 pm Post subject: Holidays in the 80's! (Ongoing list)
I'm thinking about finding and watching 80s cartoon episodes and specials (and non-animated children's specials as well!) from the holidays.
I found a few already, but I'm specifically looking for ones from Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's. I'll take the old classics that were re-aired regularly through the 80's as well, like the Grinch, Frosty, Rudolph, and the Charlie Brown specials, just add the year for reference.
Some cartoons had individual episodes, like the Smurfs' "Littlest Witch" or the Pac-man ones. I'm at work, so I don't have the same list with me as I have at home. I'll post with it when I get a chance.
Halloween Specials:
Which Witch is Which?
Garfield's Halloween Adventure
Mr. Boogedy
The Worst Witch
Disney's Halloween Treat
Frankenweenie
The Great Bear Scare
It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown (1966)
Bugs Bunny's Howl-o-ween Special (1978)
Halloween Cartoon Episodes:
Smurfs: "The Littlest Witch"
Pac-Man: "Pacula", "Trick or Chomp"
Pound Puppies: ???
Thanksgiving:
Christmas:
New Years: This will get updated over time as you guys submit information! _________________Aurora

Posted: Tue Oct 27, 2009 2:14 pm Post subject: Well, since they've pretty much been re-aired every year since their original airings, I would definitely go ahead and list the Charlie Brown specials.
"It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown"
"A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving"
"A Charlie Brown Christmas"
Those are 3 classics! This may also be helpful to you in picking out '80s classics for your lists.

Posted: Sat Oct 31, 2009 3:15 pm Post subject: Since the lists didn't mention them, there are The Real Ghostbusters' Halloween specials:
When Halloween Was Forever (1986): When the ancient fiend Samhain is released from his stone prison by the ghosts and goblins of New York, the Ghostbusters must stop him from freezing time so Halloween will never end. This is one of my favorite episodes of any show, ever.
Halloween II 1/2 (1987): Samhain and his minions attack and capture the firehouse, kicking out the Ghostbusters and taking the Junior Ghostbusters hostage. Very impressive animation.
The Halloween Door (1989): Musical episode. A crotchety old man accidentally releases a host of eldritch horrors trying to prevent the children of his neighborhood from celebrating Halloween. Boogaloo's villain song is catchy._________________

"The He-man & She-Ra Christmas Special" (85)
"the Witches Night out" (7
"the Adventures of Ichabod" (49)
I'm also a big fan of the Christmas Carol. The Flintstones (94), the Jetsons (85), the Muppets (92) and the Mickey mouse (83) versions can usually be caught on tv.
....and the Pinky and the Brian Christmas Special (95) was really good. And the Halloween Tree (93) has been doing pretty good._________________><))'> teddy0bear

Posted: Mon Dec 21, 2009 11:02 pm Post subject: There's an animated TV special from 1987 called The Adventures of Candy Claus. It's about a doll that comes to life and is raised by Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus as their daughter.
Here's the IMDb page on it:
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446665/
The cartoon even seems to be on Youtube:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_EXcO-qk00
I remember that "Alvin and the Chipmunks" had a Christmas special, but it already seems to be mentioned in the Wikipedia page that's been posted.

http://www.amazon.com/GLO-Friends-Save-Christmas-VHS/dp/6300157539
According to the Christmas specials wiki, it first aired in December 1985

Posted: Tue Sep 06, 2011 2:29 pm Post subject: In fact, you probably may like to look through that whole wiki for Christmas specials in any case- http://christmas-specials.wikia.com/wiki/
I would think Halloween, Thanksgiving, New Year's Day, and other specific religious holidays- Hannukah, Kwanzaa, etc.- would be a much smaller list...
In fact, about the only New Year's Day specials I can think are:
Happy New Year, Charlie Brown!
and
Rudolph's Shiny New Year_________________"I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. No man comes to the Father but by me." - Jesus (John 14:6)

You can count on just about every single animated series since the dawn of time that has been syndicated for an entire season will definitely have a Christmas episode. Good chance there might be Halloween and Thanksgiving episodes as well.
Paul Fusco (Creator of Alf) Holiday Specials:
-Crown of Bogg (1981) - Halloween Special
-Santas Magic Toy Bag (1983) -Thanksgiving Tale (1983)
-The Valentines Day that nearly wasnt (1983) (Presumably lost aside from a few clips a certain Youtube user put up. Dont try hes a little bitch and wont trade/sell full copies. Fusco himself doesnt even have the master to this one!)
If anyone is interested I have the highest quality set of these Fusco Specials. None have ever been released on home video and stuff like 'Crown of Bogg' was only aired twice on Showtime channel back in 81-82! I have copies of these specials direct from Paul Fusco! They will never be officially released which is sad.
Some other random specials from the 80s:
Fat Albert's Halloween Special
Bugs Bunny Valentines Day Special
Popeyes Valentine Special: Sweethearts at Sea
A Very Merry Cricket
The Nutcracker Fantasy A Cosmic Christmas
Intergalactic Thanksgiving
Easter Fever
Rome-0 and Julie-8 (was originally aired as a Valentines day special)
Mad, Mad, Mad Monsters!
Halloween Tree
The Midnight Hour
Marc Summers Magical Mystery Tour (AKA Marc Summers Magic Halloween Special)
Witches Night Out
Heres a good reference for Halloween stuff: http://halloweenspecials.blogspot.com

Oddly, Chewbacca's wife and son, Mala and Lumpy, were played by males. And, is it me, or doesn't Carie Fisher as Princess Leia, singing that song at the end, look like she's high or drunk?_________________

Book Report: Neil Young “Waging Heavy Peace”
"Some of them are complete pieces of s**" - Neil Young discussing his own recordings.	December 18, 2012 10:20 AM
Filed Under: Homegrown, Neil Young, Ronald Reagan, Tonight's The Night, Waging Heavy Peace
photo credit: Maria Ives
In the past few years, a number of rock legends have picked up the proverbial pen to set the record straight on their personal stories. Keith Richards, Eric Clapton and Sting have all told their tales in book form, and this year has seen a lot of icons hit the book store. So, just in time for the holidays, we’re offering brief takes on some of 2012′s best rock tomes.
THE BOOK: Waging Heavy Peace
AUTHOR: Neil Young THE DEAL: Years after Young tried to sue author Jimmy McDonough to prevent the release of the exhaustive biography Shakey (even though he had done a number of interviews with the author for the book), Neil now tells his own story… in very Dylan-esque non-linear style. PAGES: 497
THREE THINGS WE LEARNED:
If you’re a Neil Young fan because you love After The Goldrush and Rust Never Sleeps, but you really can’t stand Trans or Landing On Water, don’t feel bad. When discussing his many archival projects (including releases of his live recordings and a 10-disc box set), he says: “The fact that I want to create a chronological history of my recordings and supporting work is proof-positive that I am an incurable collector, confronted with an amazingly detailed array of creations that I have painstakingly rat-holed over the years. Some of them are complete pieces of s***, but they have their place in my chronological obsession.” As for his condition as an incurable collector, he lists “cars, trains, manuscripts, photographs, tape recordings, records, memories and clothing” as some of the things he collects. He still may release the long-unreleased Homegrown album.
In the mid-’70s, Young worked at such a furious pace, he didn’t have the opportunity to release all of the music he was working on. He was going to release an acoustic-based album called Homegrown, recorded in Nashville with a band that included the late Band drummer Levon Helm. Instead, he put out Tonight’s The Night, which had been finished for two years by then. “I had delayed it originally, having felt it was not yet the right time for release, and also I had a sense that it needed something else added to it for perspective. I did find those tracks eventually, and then the record was complete. Now when I listen to it, I am not sure about that decision.” He’s still trying to explain his pro-Ronald Reagan comments from the ’80s.
He dedicates a short chapter to this. He had done an interview with two AP reporters in his bus: “They came on the bus and started right off making derogatory remarks about Reagan. They were presumptuous; I could see they thought they had me al figured out. I was that hippie who wrote ‘Ohio’ and ‘Southern Man’ and sang with that group CSNY. I told them I did not believe in painting someone with one brush… I liked Reagan for some things he had said. Reagan had talked about the need for communities to come together to help themselves in ways that I thought were reasonable, and I told them that I did not believe that he was the villain so many had painted him to be.” They wrote a story making Young look like a Reagan supporter. “Since the moment I met those two AP jerks, I have been trying to straighten out what they said. What they said I said.” Young’s story doesn’t appear to be slowing down. He reunited with Crazy Horse earlier this year, releasing two new albums, Americana and Psychedelic Pill.

AUDIO: 911 calls from Asiana plane crash released
Tweet
Posted Thursday, July 11th 2013 @ 9am (Jason Howerton) The California Highway Patrol has released audio of the emergency calls connected to the deadly Asiana Airlines Flight 214 plane crash at San Francisco International Airport on Saturday.
The newly released audio includes a call from a female passenger who was on the plane when it crashed.
“We just got in a plane crash and there are a lot of people that need help,” she says. “We have people over here that weren’t found and they are burned really badly.”
The 911 audio also includes a call from a man who was hiking on a trail when the plane crashed. The man can be heard telling the dispatcher where the crash occurred and that he heard a “giant explosion.”
Another woman from the plane tells a dispatcher the plane had been on the tarmac for 20 minutes but no ambulances were on site.
“There are people laying on the tarmac with critical injuries…we are trying to keep our lives,” she says.

[ The ‘Suicide Squad’ Trailer Is Recreated With The DC Animated Universe And It’s Pretty Darn Cool
By Chris Sims
4 days ago | ComicsAlliance The trailer for Suicide Squad might have been a little divisive when it came to convincing people that the movie itself was worth seeing, but the one thing we can all agree on was that it was a pretty great trailer. It was put together very well, with music and dialogue that set a tone that no other DC movie has managed to capture. And now, it's been put together again, but with a twist.
YouTube's own Reuven White has re-cut the trailer using footage from the DC Animated Universe, including Batman: The Animated Series, Justice League and more, matching it all up to the audio from the official version, and it's pretty great. Give it a watch!

Cee-Lo, Gwyneth Paltrow Performance Not One “You” Will Soon “Forget”
February 13, 2011 11:12 PM
Filed Under: grammys 2011, Gwyneth Paltrow
Tonight GRAMMY nominee [lastfm link_type=”artist_info”]Cee-Lo[/lastfm] took to the futuristic stage with a little help from Jim Henson’s Muppets, and Gwyneth Paltrow and belted out his hit song, “Forget You”.
Cee-Lo got the performance rocking by wearing what looked like an Elmo costume after a peacock jumped on his back (don’t believe me, check out the performance), and playing a piano that even [lastfm link_type=”artist_info”]Elton John[/lastfm] would be jealous of…which only means one thing… IT WAS AWESOME! [lastfm link_type=”artist_info”]Gwyneth Paltrow[/lastfm] entered from the top of the stage wearing all black and a dangerously low-cut V-neck skin tight outfit, and sang her heart out, and she sounded damn good (and looked good)!
The performance wrapped up with Gwyneth laying on the piano face-to-face with Cee-Lo, in a performance we will not soon forget.

Eminem & Rihanna to perform at MTV Movie Awards
Eminem & Rihanna to perform at MTV Movie Awards
Tweet
Posted Wednesday, April 9th 2014 @ 7am Listen to Eminem on iHeartRadio | Listen to Rihanna on iHeartRadio
Eminem and Rihanna have been added to the lineup for this weekend's MTV Movie Awards. The stars are set to perform their hit "The Monster" during the awards show, marking their first-ever televised performance of the song. Both have been asked to perform before. Rihanna sang with Jay Z back in 2007, and Eminem was a guest in 2009. Their MTV appearance will be a preview of their upcoming joint tour, also named for the song. The trek will cover six dates in Pasadena, New York and Detroit starting on August 7th. The MTV Movie Awards are set to air live from the Nokia Theater in Los Angeles on Sunday night with host Conan O'Brien. Ellie Goulding and Zedd will be performing as well. Photo Credit Getty Images

Automatically Labeling the Inputs and Outputs of Web Services
Automatically Labeling the Inputs and Outputs of Web Services
Kristina Lerman, Anon Plangprasopchok, Craig A. Knoblock
Information integration systems combine data from multiple heterogeneous Web services to answer complex user queries, provided a user has semantically modeled the service first. To model a service, the user has to specify semantic types of the input and output data it uses and its functionality. As large number of new services come online, it is impractical to require the user to come up with a semantic model of the service or rely on the service providers to conform to a standard. Instead, we would like to automatically learn the semantic model of a new service. This paper addresses one part of the problem: namely, automatically recognizing semantic types of the data used by Web services. We describe a metadata-based classification method for recognizing input data types using only the terms extracted from a Web Service Definition file. We then verify the classifier's predictions by invoking the service with some sample data of that type. Once we discover correct classification, we invoke the service to produce output data samples. We then use content-based classifiers to recognize semantic types of the output data. We provide performance results of both classification methods and validate our approach on several live Web services.

Preface
Preface
Barry O'Sullivan, Klas Orsvarn
The main goal of the workshop was to promote high-quality research in all technical areas related to configuration. The workshop was of interest to researchers working in the various fields within the wide range of applicable AI technologies. It served as platform for researchers and industrial participants to exchange needs, ideas, benchmarks, and use cases. Collocated with AAAI-07 the Workshop on Configuration provided an ideal forum to attract high-quality submissions.

About Trades in Focus Trades in Focus is a year-long collaborative initiative between the American Association of Community Colleges (AACC) and W.W. Grainger, Inc., a leading broad-line supplier of facilities-maintenance products. The initiative’s purpose is: to promote awareness about the importance of industrial-trade professions
to highlight the corresponding training and skills that community colleges offer to underscore the opportunities for good jobs that industrial skilled-trade programs provide. The Trades in Focus toolkit includes a series of templates that community colleges can use to develop their own promotional campaigns for targeted audiences—i.e. policy-makers, industry partners, returning veterans, and other important stakeholders.

Abang Long Punya Cerita: Dua pemain bola sepak Pahang ditahan berkhalwat

Dua pemain bola sepak Pahang ditahan berkhalwat
Pegawai penguatkuasa Jabatan Agama Islam Pahang (Jaip) menahan dua pemain bola sepak Pahang kerana disyaki berkhalwat di sebuah hotel di bandar ini, semalam.Menurut sumber, dua pemain skuad Tok Gajah berusia 20-an itu ditahan bersama pasangan masing-masing di bilik berasingan kira-kira pukul 4.30 pagi.Serbuan itu dilakukan sepasukan pegawai penguatkuasa Jaip hasil maklumat orang awam yang mengesyaki mereka mendaftar masuk bersama pasangan bukan muhrim.Hasil pemeriksaan di bilik pertama mendapati seorang pemain Pahang yang dipercayai bermain di posisi tengah pasukan bersama seorang wanita bukan muhrim berada dalam bilik berkenaan, kata sumber itu.Menurutnya pemeriksaan di sebuah bilik berdekatan pula mendapati rakannya yang dipercayai pemain pertahanan Pahang berada bersama seorang wanita sebelum mereka ditahan kerana disyaki berkhalwat.Sumber itu berkata sebelum pintu kedua-dua bilik hotel itu dibuka, pegawai penguatkuasa Jaip mengetuk pintu bilik beberapa kali selain memperkenalkan diri sebagai pegawai penguatkuasa.Menurutnya siasatan awal mendapati kedua-dua pemain yang belum berkahwin itu mengaku berkhalwat bersama pasangan masing-masing yang berusia 20-an.Kesemua mereka katanya dibawa ke Pejabat Jaip untuk siasatan lanjut mengikut Seksyen 145 Enakmen Pentadbiran Ugama Islam dan Adat Resam Melayu Pahang 1982. -- BERNAMA Posted by

Hello(:: Honey, Turmeric, and Yogurt Mask~
Hello(:
Saturday, July 28, 2012
Honey, Turmeric, and Yogurt Mask~
I've explained the benefits of Yogurt on here before. Basically, its a really good moisturiser. Honey is high in anti oxidants that make your skin soft and radiant(: Turmeric is known for its Ayurvedic values as inflammatory, anti-aging, and antiseptic agents. So, heres how to make the mask(:
Ingredients:
1 cup of PLAIN yogurt
2 tablespoons of honey
2 teaspoons of organic turmeric powder
Combine all of these together and mix until its smooth. Apply the mask and leave it on for 15 minutes. Wash with warm water and pat dry.
Enjoy!~

Kate Middleton lookalike poses for baby shower photo

May 5, 2013 12:00:00 AM PDT
LONDON -- Lookalikes posing as Kate Middleton and other British royalty recently appeared in a photo of a pretend baby shower, and the results are quite convincing.Photographer Alison Jackson asked the impersonators to pose for a photo shoot. The woman posing as Middleton sits front and center amid lookalikes of everyone from Pippa Middleton to Queen Elizabeth and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. The women are shown making a toast as the Middleton impostor opens gifts. A real royal baby shower isn't planned, however. Victoria Arbiter, ABC News royal expert, says Prince William, 30, and his wife "are clearly very wealthy and a lavish baby shower would be seen as highly inappropriate." The lack of a baby shower inspired Jackson's photo shoot. Though Middleton, 31, is due in mid-July, she has already begun baby shopping. She was spotted at the Blue Almonds boutique in London last month. ABC News contributed to this report.

OTRC: Robin Roberts announces plans to return to 'Good Morning America'
Robin Roberts appears on 'Good Morning America' on Monday, Jan. 14, 2013.
By
OnTheRedCarpet.com Staff
Robin Roberts on Monday appeared on "Good Morning America" and made a big announcement regarding her health. "I'm so happy to be sharing this news with everybody," said Roberts. "[My] last bone marrow test showed no abnormalities. The majority of the marrow is my sister's and it is healthy. Praise God. What all this means, my doctors are waiting for this information to be able to tell me that I can be in the process of returning to the anchor chair." Roberts said she hopes to return sometime in February, but she did not specify a date. The 52-year-old has remained in good spirits since undergoing rigorous chemotherapy treatments and a bone marrow transplant to treat myelodysplastic syndrome, a rare blood and bone marrow disease. Roberts revealed her MDS diagnosis in June and has been on medical leave from "Good Morning America" since the end of August. Roberts received a bone marrow transplant from her sister, Sally, in September. The Walt Disney Company owns the ABC Television Network and eight local news stations, such as KABC Television, OTRC.com's parent firm. (Copyright ©2016 OnTheRedCarpet.com. All Rights Reserved.)

Star General MotorsLocal Omaha Cadillac saleswoman impresses famous "secret shopper." 0 Shares
Email An Omaha Cadillac saleswoman had no idea that she was selling a car to Warren Buffett, but the billionaire found her so impressive that he personally requested she deliver the new car herself.
Madison Willers, 23, welcomed a customer at Huber Cadillac in Omaha, Nebraska, in May with a smile, just as she greets all of her customers. What Willers did not realize, however, is that her customer was Susie Buffett, there on a mission to purchase a new car for her father, Warren Buffett.
"When I was talking to Susie, it was clear that the car wasn't for her," Willers told ABC News.

Willers spoke with the woman and walked her through choosing the right vehicle for the mystery driver, just as she would any customer.
When the customer asked for Willers’ card at the end of the conversation, the saleswoman just assumed the customer was actually a “secret shopper” testing her product knowledge.
The customer came back a few days later to make the vehicle purchase, finally introducing herself as Susie Buffett and revealing the car was for her father.
"When Susie told me who her father was, I was surprised," said Willers, "I told her, 'That's awesome. Your father and I go way back.'" Willers had been Buffett's server many time when she had worked as a waitress at a restaurant in Omaha.
Warren Buffett specifically requested that Willers’ personally deliver his new car so he could say hello, and the two were able to snap a picture in front of the new car.
"I was honored and humbled that he remembered me and wanted to say hello," said Willers.
Warren Buffett ultimately wrote a letter, on Berkshire Hathaway letterhead, to the General Motors CEO Mary Barra, praising the saleswoman for a job well done.
General MotorsWarren Buffet is so impressed with saleswoman he writes a letter to GM CEO.
